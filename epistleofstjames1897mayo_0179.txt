with Paul. Yet even in the Old Tcstament the law is called
perfect (Ps. xix. 7, and liberty is associated with the law (Ps. cxix.
45), ‘I will walk at liberty, for I seek Thy precepts'3 ib. 32, ‘I
will run the way of Thy commandments when Thou shalt enlarge
my heart’); so, when St. Paul contrasts the fieshy tables of the
heart with tables of stone, he only reproduces the words of the
prophet, ‘I will put my law in their inward parts.’ Nor was the
idea of a law of liberty strange to the rabbinical writers or to
Philo. Spitta quotes from Pirke Aboth vi. 2 (a comment on
Exodus xxxii. 6), ‘None is free but the child of the law‚⁷ and
from Philo ii. 452, ‘ ὅσοι μετὰ νόμου ζῶσιν ἐλεύθεροι.’

Ι now proceed to the consideration of the section on Faith and
Works‚ which is put forward as a crucial instance in favour of the
late date of the Epistle. To narrow the field of discussion as much
as possible, I will say at once that I agree wit-h my opponents in
holding that the resemblance between this portion of the Epistle
and St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans is too great to be accidental.
One of the two must have been written with reference to the other.
I agree also in considering that the argument of St. J ames entirely
fails to meet the argument of St. Paul. It is in fact quite beside
it, and, if intended to meet it, rests upon a pure misconception of
St. Paul's meaning. From this my opponents infer that it could
not have been written by James the Just, or indeed by any
contemporary of St. Paul. The identification of Paul's faith in
Christ, which works by love, with the barren belief in the existence
of one God, which is shared even by devils3 the confusion between
the works of the law, which Paul condemns, with the fruits of
saith, which 116 demands of every Christian—this was not possible
till lapse of time had brought forgetfulness of the tyranny of the
old Mosaic law, and made it possible to understand ‘ the works of
the law’ to mean moral conduct. If James had written this
section, he would have been rudely and ignorantly attacking Paul
as guilty of heresy‚ but if it was written in the year 130, the author
might well imagine that he was only expressing St. Paul's own
meaning in other words. F eeling sure that the great Apostle
would never have encouraged the idea that a mere profession of
orthodoxy could win heaven, he might naturally seek to follow his
language as closely as possible in giving their due weight to faith
and works respectively (‘deshalb stellte er mit moglichst nahem
Anschluss an Paulus' Worte fest, wie beide Glaube und W erke zu
