ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxiii

quently on a later visit of St. Paul to Jerusalem (Acts xxi. 26),
would have failed to make use of the opportunity to urge the
Jews of the Dispersion to observe the terms of the compact and
deal fairly by their Gentile neighbours. Nor does it seem
possible to accept Dr. Plummer's suggestion that it may have
been written between 53 and 62 (Sc. εἷα-11103, p. 61), after the
controversy on the subject had cooled down, because we have
no evidence that the controversy did cool down during that period.
On the contrary, the furious assault of the Jews on St. Paul at
Jerusalem (A.D. 58) turned on this very question. When he
began to speak of his commission to the Gentiles, they burst out,
‘Away with such a fellow from the earth ' (Acts xxii. 22) 3 and St.
J ames had previously warned him that, among the believing Jews,
there were many thousands zealous for the law, who had been
informed that he taught the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake
Moses and not to circumcise their children (Acts xxi. 20, 21).
This was at Jerusalem: how far the excitement was from having
cooled down in the provinces, is evident from the Epistle to the
Galatians (57). It does not seem that the baptism of Cornelius
had aroused anything like the same exasperation‚ partly no doubt
because St. Peter was not suspected as St. Paul was, partly because
Cornelius was already a ‘proselyte of the gate,' and did not pass at
once from heathenism to Christianity like St. Paul‘s converts. On
hearing the explanation of the former ‘ they of the circumcision
held their peace and glorified God⁷ (Acts xi. 18). There is no
reason therefore for throwing back the date of the Epistle to the
period before the conversion of Cornelius. But it probably was
not much later, for we read shortly afterwards (Acts xi. 20) that the
Greeks in Antioch received the word from some of those who had
been scattered in the persecution of Stephen, and that Barnabas
was sent from Jerusalem to inquire into the circumstances
Another evidence of the early date of the Epistle may be

found in the hints which it lets fall as to Church discipline and Ο
order. The synagogue is their place of meeting, though it is 003³
a synagogue of which Christians have the control.1 No men- ame
tion is made of ‘bishops' or ‘deacons‚' but only of teachers auce

and elders (iii. 1, v. 14). Teaching seems to be still quite
unorganized, as in the Church of Corinth (1 Cor. xiV. 26 foll.): it
is not confined to regularly ordained church Officers: there is no
