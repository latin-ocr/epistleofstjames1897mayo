clxxxviii INTRODUCTION

definite subject first, and then adds its qualification as a second
thought; (3) gives an indefinite subject first, and afterwards defines
it by its qualification: this has still more the air of a second
thought. Both (2) and (3) may serve a rhetorical purpose by
giving prominence to the qualification‚ which is to some extent
merged and lost in (1). The last (4) is the least artistic form, and
gives the mental impression in its first rough shape, unmodified by
the secondary action of the mind.

In these compound phrases the use of the article is also affected
by what may be called the Law of Correlation or Sympathy. If
one noun is dependent on another, the article is, in general, used
either with both or with neither3 and thus, if the 0116 noun can
dispense with the article, it is sometimes omitted with the other
also, even when, if it stood alone, the latter would naturally have
taken the article. Thus we have ἄνθος χόρτου i. 10, not ἄνθος
τοῦ χόρτου, δοῦλος Θεοῦ 1. 1, not δοῦλος τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀκροατὴς λόὙου
1. 23, not ἀκροατὴς τοῦ λόὙου, ἡμέρα σφανγῆς, 11013 τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
σφαγῆς or ἡμέρα τῆς σφαγῆς, νόμον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας i. 25, διὰ
νόμου ἐλευθερίας ii. 125 so ἔργα νόμου or τὰ ἕρὙα τοῦ νόμον, not
ἕρτγα τοῦ νόμου or τὰ ἔργα νόμου. Apparent exceptions may
sometimes be explained (as V. 10 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, 11. 11 τὸ
τέλος Κυρίου) by the fact that Κύριος 15 a proper name, the con—
struction being the same as in τὴν ὑπομονὴν Ἰώβ.

From the above uses of the article in an attributive phrase we
must carefully distinguish its use in predication‚ of which the type
15 ἀγαθὸς ὁ ἀνήρ, 13116 subject being known by the presence of the
article, the predicate by its absence, as in i. 26 τούτου μάταιος ἡ
θρησκεία, iV. 4 ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου ἔχθρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστίν. Hence
we characterize μακάριος ἁνήρ 111 i. 12 as a predicate (like τέλειος
ἀνήρ 111 iii. 2), ‘He is a blessed inan who‚’ instead of dividing
them with the English Version and making ἀνήρ subject,
‘Blessed is the man? The same phrase is shown 130 116 predica-
tive in Rom. iv. 8 (μακάριος ἁνήρ οὗ οὐ μὴ λογίσηται ἁμαρτίαν)
by the preceding μακάριοι ὧν ἀφέθησαν αἱ ἀνομίαι. 111 James ii.
19 εἷς ἐστὶν ὁ θεός the presence of the article shows that εἷς 15
predicative 3 in iv. 12, if we read εἷς ἐστὶν νομοθέτης, 13116 absence
of the article shows that εἷς 15 subJect3 but if we read εἷς ἔστιν
νομοθέτης, making ἐστιν not the copula, but the substantive verb,
,εἷς becomes an epithet of νομ. ‘there is one lawgiver.⁷ And so
«θρησκεία καθαρά 111 i. 27 ‘this, viz. visiting widows and orphans,
