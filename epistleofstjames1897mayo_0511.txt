V 12-20 CONVERTING THE SINNER :331

CONVERTING THE Smnmz.

Is this 6 new case, or another aspect of the case of the sick 1116111
If the latter, it seems to imply strange sloth and lukewarmness on the
part of the Elders, that they should stand in need of exhortation to the
performance of a duty, which would not have seemed to be particularly
arduous or irksome. The previous verses insist on their power to heal
the disease and procure forgiveness by their prayers: V. 20 speaks of
the reward. If, as seems more likely, it is 6 new case, St. Jaines may
have added it as an afterthougbt on finding that his warnings had
been chiefly against over-activity‚ too much vehemence, too much
eagerness to tcach. In ver. 14 he had begun to speak of our duty
towards the sick in body3 in ver. 16 he had extended this into a general
precept as 10 mutual help in spiritual 1116113616, 111 ver. 19 he turns to the
case of the backsliders. Even here nothing is said as to the duty of
the Church to go out into all the world and preach the Gospel to eveiy
creature3 nothing is said as to making proselytes from the Gentiles or
even from the unbelieving Jews. It is the exhortation of the Bishop,
whose aim is the reformation and improvement of the 011111011, 1101 of
the Apostle‚ whose aim is the extension of the Church by the diffusion
of the faith.

In my 11016 Ι have pointed out that the words of ver. 20, ‘ he who
recalls an erring brother saves (or ‘ will save ⁷) his soul from death and
will be the means of blotting out many sins' are capable of two
interp1·etations‚ according to the reference we give 10 (1116] Ι have
mentioned some difficulties which lie in the way of our taking ‘ his ⁷ to
refer to the sinner‚ and have shown that it was not uncommon with
Jewish writers to hold forth the prospect of salvation and forgive-
·ness of sins, as an inducement to certain kinds of right conduct,
such as alins-giving. I postponed 10 1116 present occasion the
consideration of the question whether it was possible that St. Jamcs
should have adopted a similar mode of speaking. We cannot, of
course, imagine that he would ever have dreamt of 6 man's being
able to atone for his own sins bv his assiduity in calling others to
repentancc. Such 6 11011011 16 forbidden, not less by our L0rd⁷s words
recorded in Matt. vii. 20 -22 ‘ Many will say 10 me in that day, Lord‚
have we not prophesied in thy name? . . . then will I profess unto
them, Ι never knew you 3 depart from me, ye that work iniquity,’ and
by the words of St. Paul in 1 Cor. xiii. 1-3‚ ‘ Though I speak with the
tongues of men and angels . . . though I have the gift of prophecy . . .
though I have all faith . . . though I give my body to be burm, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing,' and in ch. ix. 26, 27 ‘ I keep
under my body and bring it into subjection, lest having preached to
others, I myself should be a castaway,'—than by the words of
St. James himself, ‘Be not many masters, knowing that we shall
receive the greater condemnation‚' and by his constant depreciation of
mere speaking, unaccompanied by deeds and practice. St. James has
told us already how the soul is saved (i. 21-25): not by preaching to
