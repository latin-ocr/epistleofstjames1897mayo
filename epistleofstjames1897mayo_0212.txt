cxcii INTRODUOTION

latter expressions is the same, but in Colossians it is stated at
length, whereas in Corinthians the Apostle just touches it in his
rapid enumeration of the different ways in which he showed him-
self a minister of God. Similarly we have Miryov ζωῆς Phil. ii. 16.
Both λόνγος and ἀλήθεια belong to the class of abstract words
which may either take the article or not, according to the pleasure
of the speaker; and if one is made anarthrous, the other will
usually be so too by the rule of sympathy or correlation. A
precisely similar case is ii. 12 διὰ νόμου ἐλευθερίας μέλλοντες κρί-
νεσθαι. In both cases I think the qualifying noun gains additional
importance by the omission of the article. In ii. 8 we have the
anarthrous adjective νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικόν, where the adjective
comes in rather as an after-thought to complete the phrase νόμον
τελεῖτε. In my note J have compared πνεῦμα ἅγιον, διαθήκη
ἁγία Luke i. 72, 1 Mace. i. 15, 73.

The remaining case (i. 25> combines the adjective and the genitive
νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας. Here the addition would be
quite regular if τέλειον were absent. It is best, I think, to regard
νόμον τέλειον as parallel to νόμον βασιλικόν above, being equiva-
lent to τὸν τέλειον νόμον.

It must indeed be confessed that the Hellenistic writers are
very lax in their use of the article with a noun qualified by
an attributive adjective or genitive. They may be said to have
introduced into Greek prose the freedom of Greek poetry, itself a
tradition handed down from the Homeric ages, before the use of
the article had been developed out of the demonstrative pronoun.
This freedom would naturally commend itself to foreigners
learning Greek, to whom Greek gender would be as great a
stumbling—block as German or French gender is to Englishmen
now, and who, as a matter of fact, did often confuse the
masculine and neuter gender, see above p. clxxxi. We find
examples in Baruch i. 3 ἐν ὦσι παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ, where ἐν ὦσι
may be regarded as a prepositional phrase (like ἐκ στόματος λεόν-
των 1 Maec. ii. 60), Bar. i. S τὰ σκεύη οἴκου Κυρίου, where the
omission of the article before οἴκου is probably to be explained by
its forming a phrase With Κυρίου, Sir. i. 5 ῥίζα σοφίας τίνι ἀπε-
καλύφθη; (‘ the root of wisdom'), ver. 9 φόβος Κυρίου καύχημα
‘the sear of the Lord is glory,' ver. 16 στέφανος σοφίας φόβος
Κυρίου ‘the sear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,' vii. 9 Θεῷ
ὑψίστῳ ‘to the most high God‚' xxxi. 13 πνεῦμα φοβουμένων
