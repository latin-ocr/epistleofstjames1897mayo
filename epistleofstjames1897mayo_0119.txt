expression of J ames (i. 21) ‘ Wherefore putting away all filthiness
and overflowing of maline, receive with meekness the implanted
word which is able to save your souls' is elaborated into ‘Putting
away therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and
envies and all evil speakings, as newborn babes long for the
spiritual (λογικόν) milk which is without guile, that ye may grow
thereby unto salvation! Compare also J ames i. 12 with 1 Pet. v, 4
where ‘the crown of life’ becomes ‘ the crown of glory which fadeth
not away '3 James iv, 10 with 1. Pet. V. 6, where ‘ Humble your—
selves in the sight of God and he shall exalt you' becomes
‘Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may
exalt you in due time.' In the immediate context the simple
‘ Resist the devil ’ of James, becomes ‘ Your adversary the devil as
aroaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 3 whom
resist stedfast in the faith' in Peter. The most important
changes are those in which the tone of the New Testament is sub—
stituted for that of the Old, as in 1 Pet. 11. 21, where Christ is set
before us as our example of patient suffering, in contrast with
James v. 10, where the example of the prophets 15 appealed to.
Perhaps under this head may be mentioned the change from στηρί-
ξατε τὰς καρδίας, 111 dames V. 9, to ὁ Θεὸς αὐτὸς στηρίξει 111 1 Pet.
v.10; and the employment of the emphatic πρὸ ’πάντων to enforce
the exhortation to brotherly love in 1 Pet. iv, S, instead of the
exhortation to abstain from swearing in James V. 12.

There is a curious difference between the use made of quotations
from the Old Testament in the two Epistles. St.Ja1nes seldom
quotes exactly. We can see by his phraseology that he has some
passage of the Old Testament in his mind, but he uses it freely
to colour his language, applying it to his own immediate purpose
without any scrupulous reference to its original context. It is this
laxity of quotation which causes the difficulty in J ames iv. 4-ss and
presents what is probably an ‘unwritten word ' of Christ under Ψ
two forms in i. 12 and ii. 5. If we turn to the quotations which
are common to him and to St. Peter, we often find the inexact and
careless reminiscences of the former corrected and supplemented
in the latter. Thus there can be little doubt that when St. J ames
used the phrase δοκίμιον πίστεως 110 had in his mind Prov. xxvii.
21 δοκίμιον ἀρὙυρίῳ καὶ χρυσῷ πύρωσις, ἀνὴρ δὲ δοκιμάζεται
διὰ στόματος ἐγκωμιαζόντων αὐτόν, and Prov. xvii. 3, which is
