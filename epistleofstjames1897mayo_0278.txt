cclviii INTRODUCTION

James is not cited at all by Tertullian 1 or Cyprian‚ and rarely
cited by Latin writers before the time of Jerome and Augustine,
the former of whom has 133 quotatiom, the latter 389 (stud. Bibl„
pp. 128, 129).

The following writers are referred to in the critical notes. The
exact references will be found in Tischendorf :—

Aug. Augustine, 4th century. Epiph. Epiphanius, 4th century.
Cass. Cassiodorius, 6th. ι161. Jerome, 4th.

Cyr. Cyri] of Alexandria, 5th. Oec. Oeeumenius, llth.

Dam. Joannes Damascenus, Sth. Orig. Origen, 3rd.

Did. Didymus of Alexandria, 4th. Τ111. Theophylact, 11th.

Eph. Ephraem Syrrm, 4th. Zig. Euthymius Zigabenus, 12th.

1 Roiiseh (Das Neue Testamenti Tertullz'mzs, 1871) agrees with this statement.
In my note on ch. v. 16, πολὺ ἰσχύει, Ι have quoted a passage from Tert. De
Oratione which seems to me a reminiscence of St. James, bnt it must be allowed
that nfither Tei-tullian nor Cyprian cites him as an authority where they might well
have 0116 50.
