5 ἡλίκους ἡμᾶς ἀποφαίνεις, οὐδὲ κατὰ τοὺς πυγμαιόυς ἐκείνους ἀλλὰ χαμαι-
πετεῖς παντάπασιν, the context shows the meaning to be ‘how small ' :
so in Epict. D‘iss. I. 12. 26 ἡλίκον μέρος πρὸς τὰ ὅλα. The reference to
a burning forest is common both in the Bible‚ as Ps. lxxxiii. 14 ὡσεὶ
πῦρ ὃ διαφλέξει δρυμόν, ὡσεὶ φλὸξ κατακαῦσαι ὅρη, 153. 1Χ. 18, X. 17, IS,
Zech. xii. 63 and elsewhere, as Hom. Ic. 455 πῦρ ἀΐδηλον ἐπιφλέγει
ἄσπετον ὕλην οὔρεος ἐκ κορυφῆς, Thuc. ii. 77, Pind. J'gestlzs. iii. 66, Eur. Im)

6. ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ.] Prov. XVi. 27 (ἀνὴρ ἄφρων) ἐπὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ χειλέων
θησαυρίζει πῦρ, ib. xxvi. 18-22, Sir. xxviii. 11 ἔρις κατασπευδομένη ἐκκαίει
πῦρ, ib. V. 22 οὐ μὴ κρατήσῃ εὐσεβῶν (ἡ γλῶσσα) καὶ ἐν τῇ φλογὶ αὐτῆς οὐ
Ἰκαήο-ονται, so some explain Psa. cxx, 4. On the other hand inspira-
tion from above is also symbolized by fire Acts ii. 3, Im.. vi. 6, Jer. v.
14. I cannot see why Spitta objects to the καὶ before ἡ γλῶσσα. Just
before, the writer had illustrated the thought of the great effect pro-
duced by the tongue, though itself so small, by the comparison of a
forest kindled by 3 chance spark. This suggests another aspect of
the tongue. It resembles 11Υο 111 1110 points which he proceeds to men-
tion. S. would also 0111113 ἡ γλῶσσα πῦρ and ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας as
marginal summaries, the former of VV. 6-12, 1110 latter of vv. 13-iv. 3.
Nor is even this enough to satisfy his rage for expurgation. The
clause ἡ (or καὶ) σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα 15 due to the same copyist who
added to the text the marginal summaries.

ὅ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ γλῶσσα καθίσταται ἑν τοῖς μέλεα-ιν ἡμῶν] The first·
point to be determined in this difficult verse is whether we should put
xour stop after πῦρ with the RV„ WH., Neander, Lange, Hofmann,
Erdmann, Beyschlag 3 or after ἀδικίας with the margin, Alf„ Huther,
Schegg and 1110 generality of editors. It seems to me that the former
gives the only tenable construction. The sense may be difficult, but
the grammar is clear, if we take ἡ γλῶσσα 35 subject to καθίσταται, with
1110 attributive clause ἡ σπιλοῦσα-γεέννης, and make ὃ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας
the predicate or complement. With the other punctuation ἡ σπιλοῦσα
becomes the predicate, but there is no justification for the article:
either we should have καθίσταται σπιλοῦσα 01· καθίσταται τὸ σπιλοῦν
·( μέλος) : and in either case καθίσταται 10505 115 proper force. The predi—
cate is put first for emphasis, 35 111 John i. 1 Θεὸς ἦν ὁ Λόγος, 27). iv. 24
πνεῦμα ὃ Θεός, 2 Pet. ii. 17 ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός μου οῦτός ἐστιν, Luke iv.
41 τὸν Χριστὸν αὐτὸν εἶναι, see Winer‚ p. 689f. As κόσμος 15 defined by
the genitive τῆς ἀδικίας, it necessarily keeps the article in the predicate.

the subject ἡ γλῶσσα 15 repeated from the preceding clause of course

the words are almost the same as those in St. J ames, quanta incendia linqua &scibat !
