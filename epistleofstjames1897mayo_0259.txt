DID ST. JAMES WRITE IN GREEK ΟΡ» ARAMAIOE ccxxxix

ct incendit series [sesnco'cctionum nostrarmn quac currunt veluti rotas,
ac incenditur ipsa iqnc} [On the interpolation velati silva I have
said something in my note. The interpretation of the phrase
φλοὙι’ζουσα...τῆς Γγενέσεως seems to be an explanatory para-phrase,
like that in i. 25]

iii. 17 ἀνυπόκριτος, vultum non accipiffl

iv. 9 ταλαιπωρήσατε καὶ πενθήσατε καὶ κλαύσατε, lnmnz'lmca vos
et [nycte.

iv. 16 πᾶσα καύχησις τοιαύτη πονηρά ἐστιν, omnis [Acidalio
quac est ejus modi α malo est.

v. 2 σέσηπεν, corrupta szmt et sctucrmzt.

V. 6 οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται, et ‘mon resm‘tz't.

In these variations I do not see that there is anything to sug-
gest that the Peshitto represents more truly than the Greek the
thought of the original author. On the contrary we find that the
force of the Greek is often lost or blurred by the disappearance of
a metaphor‚ as in i. 14, i. 26, iii. 2, or by the substitution of a
weaker for a more vigorous phrase, as in i. 6, i. 17, i. 21, ii. 8, iii. 6,
v. 6. The variations of the Corbey Latin seem to me to belong
generally to the same category3 and to be due either to want of
ability 01· want of conscientiousness on the part of the translator.
Where they appear to be confirmed by the variations of the Peshitto,
it is possible, as Prof. Rendel Harris has shown in his brilliant
study on the Codex Bezae‚ that the Latin was directly influenced
by the Syriac. ‘The Syriasms found in the Latin text of several
ancient MSS. exceed in harshness the Syriasms of the Greek text.³
He considers that the Latin text of the Codex Bezae dates from

the second century and arranges its constituents (prior to the end
of that century) in the following order:

(1) Original Greek Text.
(2) Original Latin Text.
(3) Poetical Glosses interpolated from the popular Homeric

centos which had been used to dress up the Gospe]
narrative.

(4) Primitive Syriae version.
(5) Montanist Glosses.
