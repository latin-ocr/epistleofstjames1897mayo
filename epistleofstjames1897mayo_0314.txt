34 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

κατεργάζεται, and see below on κατακαυχᾶσθε iii. 14. The simple verb is
similarly used below i. 20, ii. 9 ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε.1

ὑπομονήν-] Used (1) for the act of endurance (2 Cor. i. 6, vi. 4), and
(2) for the temper of endurance, as here and in the parallel passages
Rom. v. 3 and 2 Thess. i. 4. The verb is found below, ver. 12, Mart.
xxiv. 13 ὁ ὑπομείνας εἷς τέλος σωθήσεται, Rom. xii. 12 τῇ ἐλπίδι χαίροντες,
τῇ θλίψει ὑπομένοντες, τῇ προσευχῇ προσκαρτεροῦντες (where we find joy,
endurance and prayer joined as in the text), Didaehe xvi. 5 οἱ ὑπομεί-
ναντες ἐν τῇ πίστει αὐτῶν σωθήσονται. It corresponds generally to
the Aristotelian καρτερία (Cf. Heb. Xi. 27 τὸν γὰρ ἀόρατον ὡς ὀρῶν ἐκαρ-
τέρησεν) and to the Latin patientia, thus defined by Cic. Inventi. ii. 54.
163 patientia est honestatis aut utilitatis causa rerum arduarum ιιο dff-
cilium voluntaria ac diuturna perpessio ,· bul] its distinctively Christian
quality is shown in Didymus’ comment on Job vi. 5 quoted by Suicer
οὐκ ἀναίσθητον εἶναι δεῖ τὸν δίκαιον κᾶν καρτερῶς φέρῃ τὰ θλίβοντα· αὕτη
γὰρ ἀρετή ἐστιν, ὅταν αἴσθησιν τῶν ἐπιπόνων δεχόμενός τις ὖπερφρονῇ τῶν
ἀλγηδόνων διὰ τὸν Θεόν. Plus. (Cone. ad Apoll. 117) quotes from Eurip.
τὰ προσπεσόντα δ’ ὅστις εὖ φέρει βροτῶν, ἄριστος εἶναι σωφρονεῖν τέ μοι
δοκεῖ. Philo (Conq. Erud. Grac. M. 1. 524), followed by Chrysostom
(ap. Suie. 8.υ.), calls ὑπομονή 15119 queen of virtues, aud says ib is taypified
by Rebecca. Bp. Lightfoot (lisbinguishes ib from μακροθυμία (Col. i. 12) :
see below on v, Τ. Spitta cites Test. Jos. 2 ἐν δέκα πειρασμοῖς δόκιμόν
με ἀνέδειξε καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς ἐμακροθύμησα· ὅτι μέγα φάρμακον ἡ μακρο-
θυμία καὶ πολλὰ ἀγαθὰ δίδωσιν ἡ ὗπομονή, and refers ‘co Jubilees ch. 17
and 18 and the Fourth book of Maccabees as showing that the Jews
regarded Abraham as a pattern of fait-h and enduranee tested by trial.

4. ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ] See note on χαρά, Ver. 2.

ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτωο] ‘ Le‘c it: have its full effect,⁷ ‘aetam its end.' Alf,
translates ‘leb 11) have a perfer work,' bul] bhis does not quite repre-
sent the force of the original, which in colloquial English would be
rather ‘ make a complete job of it ’ Ξτελέως ἐνεργείτω. In classical
Greek we should probably have had τὸ ἔργον, but the omission of the
article emphasizes the first] point, that endumnee shall be active noi:
passive, as well as the second, that ihs activity shall nob cease till it has
accomplishecl its end. Cf. for the thought παραμείνας below ver. 25, Heb.
X. 36, Xii. 1 foll. δι’ ὑπομονῆς τρέχωμεν τὸν προκείμενον ἡμῖν ἀγῶνα, V. 5<
ἵνα μὴ κάμητε ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν ἐκλυόμενοι κ.τ.λ., Clem. Al. Str. 4. p. 570
P. τελείωσιν τὸ μαρτύριον καλοῦμεν ὅτι τέλειον ἔργον ἀγάπης ἐνεδείξατο.

τέλειοι] Nor, ‘perfec‘o’ in the sti-iet sense of the term, since πολλὰ
πταίομεν ἅπαντες (below iii. 2), though all are bidden to aim ab perfectiori,
(Mate. v. 48, Eph. iii. 19). Τ119 word occurs again below iii. 2. I‘o
is used of animals which are full grown (cf. Herod. i. 83, where τὰ
τέλεα τῶν προβάτων are opposed to γαλαθηνά, Thuc. V. 47), and hence, in
this and other passages, of Christians who have atbained maturiby of
character and understanding (Phil. iii. 15, where see Ligh'cfoob’s note,
Col. i. 28, iv. 12, esp. 1 Cor. xiv. 20, Heb. v. 12—14). Thus ib be-
