208 COMME NT

St. James ascribes to the flatterers 01 15110 rich in 1115 day. Might
does not make right nOW, any more than it did under Roman
imperialism or mediaeval feudalism. The true way 01 honouring
the masses, if we like to use that term, is first by taking for
granted that they, like the classes above them, are largely made
up 01 reasonable beings, who desire to learn the honest opinions 01 011
who have taken the trouble to form opinions for themselves 3 secondly,
by ourselves doing our best to understand their position, listening
. with respect to their opinions, and freely pointing out where we believe
them to be mistaken 3 thirdly, by seeking to make them sharers in all
the civilizing influences 01 our time, and as far as possible to raise
them to the level 01 15110 more favoured classes, in other words, by
extending as widely as possible the refinement and culture, the 5011-
respect and sels-control, implied in the old name 01 ⁴ gentleman.’ We
may hope that in these and other ways much 01 15110 bitterness 01
poverty may be done away with, and that the upward path to compe-
tence may be opened to all who are capable 01 making use of 1153 but
until human nature is entirely regenerated, the ascent 01 501110 from
the lowest class is likely to be balanced by the descent of others from
the upper classes Nor is this in 1155011 to be regretted, poverty and
want being the reformatories provided by nature for the idle and
vicious. In time past, it is true, these reformator-ies have too often
acted as incitements to crime rather than to virtue, because the
sufferers were 10115 to suffer alone, without guidance for the present or
hope for the future. The thought and effort which are now being
applied to schemes for the improvement 01 the condition 01 the
‘ submerged tenth' will, we may believe, tend to bring out the good,
and neutralize the evil 01 poverty‚ while at the same time providing a
safe channel for the exercise 01 Christian charity.

It is however important to remember that the Jewish law, forbidding
respect 01 persons, was directed not less against the partiality which
favours the poor, than against that which favours the rich. The
caution against the former, which we find in Lev. xix. 15, ‘ thou shalt-
not respect the person 01 the poor,' is certainly as much needed now as

it ever was.

SOLIDAm'rY or Dum* AND THE LAw or LIBERTY.

‘He who keeps the law as a whole and fails in one point only is
guilty 01 all! Such a principle would evidently cause great injustice,
11 applied in the administration 01 human law. A child who steals a
carrot is not thereby guilty 01 forgery and murder. If the divine law
consisted of rules relating to outward action only, as human law does,
the same would be true of it also 3 101115 15110 perfect law 01 God, as St.
James tells us in i. 25 and ii. 12, is a law 01 liberty. It is fulfilled
only when we freely choose what Gocl commands, when His will
becomes our will, when we love Him'because He loved 1153 when we
love our neighbours as ourselves, because they are children of the
same Father, redeemed by the same Saviour, partakers of the same
