but that he 15 himself by no means consistent in holding it. Thus

wly in his comment on the Galatians written about 387 A. D. he says :

J ames was called the L01d’ 5 brother on account of his high
character, his incomparable faith, and his extraordinaiy wisd0m3
the other apostles are also called brothers (John xx. 17), but he pre-
eminently 50, to whom the Lord at his departure had committed
the sons of his mother (ime the members of the Church at
J erusalem).' In a later work still, the epistle to Hedibia, written
about 406, he speaks of Mary of Cleophas (Clopas), the aunt of our
Lord‚ and Mary the mother of J ames and J oses, as distinct
persons, ‘although some contend that the mother of James and
J oses was his aunt.’

I proceed now to examine the above argument:

ι (1) It is assumed that ‘brother' (ἁδελφός) may be used in the

sense of cousin (ἀνεψιός, found in Col. iv, 10). The supporters of

ξς this theory do not offer any parallel from the Ν.Τ., but they appeal
V‘ZJ} to Classical use both in Greek and Latin, and to the O.T. The
ew examples cited from classioal Greek are merely expressive of warm

affection, or else metaphorical, as Plato, Crito, ξ 16, where the laws
of Athens are made to speak of οἱ ἡμέτεροι ἀδελφοὶ οἱ ἐν Αἴδου
νόμοι. There is no instance in Classical Greek, as far as I know, of
ἀδελφός being used to denote a cousin. In Latin frater may
stand for frater patrueli& where there is no danger of being mis-
understood (cf. 010. ad Ast. i. 5. 1). The Hebrew word is used
loosely to include cousin, as in Gen. xiv. 14—16 (of Abraham and
Lot), where the LXX. has ἀδελφιδοῦς 3 in Levit. Χ. 4«, where the first
cousins of Aaron are called brethren (ἀδελφοί) of his sons, Nadab
and Abihu 3 in 1 Chron. xxiii. 21, 22 (‘ The sons of Mahli, Eleazar
and Kish. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters : and
their brethren the sons of Kish took them ⁷), where also the LXX.
has ἀδελφοί. These passages seem to me to be hardly covered by
the general rule laid down by Bishop Lightfoot (p. 261): “in an affec·
tionate and earnest appeal intended to move the sympathies of the
hearer, a speaker might not unnaturally address a relation or a
friend or even a fellow-countryman as his ‘brother'z and even
when speaking of such to a third person he might through warmth
of feeling and under certain aspects so designate him.'’ I think,
however, the Bishop is entirely right when he goes on to say:
“‘ It is scarcely conceivable that the cousins of· any one should
