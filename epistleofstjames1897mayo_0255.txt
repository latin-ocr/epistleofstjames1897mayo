DID ST. JAMES WRITE IN GREEK ΟΒ ARAMAIOE ccxxxv

with the Vulgate salutem and ,wadium or πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε
ποικίλοις with the Vulgate ιἰι tentationes varias incideritis, none
could doubt that the former in each case was the original. A still
stronger argument will be supplied if we hold with Ewald that
i. 17 πᾶσα δόσις ἀτγαθὴ καὶ πᾶν δώρημα, τέλειον is a quotation
from a hexameter poem. Another test of a translation is the
obscurity arising from a misapprehension of the meaning of the
original. Examples of this may be found even where the translator
has a consummate mastery of his own language, eg. Ps. xlix, 5
(RB.) ‘ Wherefore should I sear when the wickedness of my heels
compasseth me about‚’ ib. lix. S ‘ Or ever your pots be made hot
with thorns, so let indignation vex him even as a thing which is
raw,' which have at last been made intelligible to English readers
in the RV. Compare also 1 Tim. vi. 5, ‘ supposing that gain is
godliness’ where the RV. has ‘supposing that godliness is a way
of gain,' or in our Epistle i. 21 ‘ superfluity of naughtiness ' where
the RV. has ‘overfiowing os wickedness.' When we meet with
an unmeaning or difficult expression of this kind in a translation,
we naturally turn to the original to see how it arose. The ques-
tion is then : Do we meet with any difficulty in our Epistle such as
might suggest that it is due to the misunderstanding of an
assumed original? Perhaps there are two passages as to which if
they occurred in an undoubted translation, we should be curious
to know what was the original intended by them. The first is the
phrase φλογίζουσα τὸν τροχὸν τῆς (γενέσεως in iii. 6, and the
second πρὸς φθόνου ἐπιποθεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα, ὃ ιεατῷκισεν ἐν ὑμῖν. It
hardly seems likely that St. James would have used the obscure
phrase ‘ wheel of existence ’ if it sounded as strange to those whom
he was addressing as it sounds to us now. The more probable
supposition is that it had got into familiar use among Greek-
speaking Jews. And this is confirmed by the parallel passages
quoted in my note. The second difficulty turns simply on the use
of the phrase πρὸς φθόνον for ‘jealously‚' to which no precise
parallel has been adduced3 but φθόνος and φθονέω being some-
times used of jealousy rather than envy‚ there seems no insuper-
able objection to a similar use of the adverbial phrase. In any
case the difficulty would not be lessened by the supposition of its
being a translation from Aramaic. On the whole we may sasely
say that the general impression produced by a study of the Greek
is much in favour of its being an original.
