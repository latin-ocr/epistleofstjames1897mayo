clxiv INTRODUOTION

was therefore introduced by one of them for the first time. Both ’
566111 10 use it as a familiar phrase. In any case we have no right
to assume that it was borrowed by <lanies from Paul; for, as I
have shown above,1 while the argument of J ames on justificatior]
bears no relation to that of Paul, the argument of Paul exactly
meets that of James. It is just like the pieces of a dissected
puzzle: put Paul above, and no amount of squeezing will bring
them together-3 put Paul below and J ames above, and they fit into
one another at once. If this is so, it is unnecessary to spend time
in showing that J ames does not quote from Hebrews and 1 Peter
and other epistles of Paul, far less from Clement or Hermas, but
all these from him. For proofs that this is so in each case, and
for the principles which should determine our judgment of priority‚
I must refer to pp. lxxxix foll„ xcviii, ciii, cxlv.

To my mind there is only one real difficulty in the supposition
that the Epistlc was written by J ames the Just, say, in the year
45, and this difficulty consists in the scanty reference to our Lord.
It is not easy to explain why J ames should have been content to
refer to J ob and the prophets, as examples of patience, where Peter
refers to Christ. It may have been,as Ι have elsewhere suggested,
that the facts of our Lord’s life were less familiar to these early
‚Jewish converts of the Diaspora than the Old Testament narratives,
which were read to thern every Sabbath day. Perhaps, too, the
Epistlc may have been intended to influence unconverted as well
as converted Jews, In any case, Ι do not see that the difficulty
becomes easier if we transfer the writing to a time when the Gros-
pels were universally read. On the other hand Spitta's hypothesis,
to which I shall turn immediately, has undoubtedly the merit of
removing it.

I have endeavoured to show that the Epistlc is a natural pro-
duct of pre-Pauline Christianity. I now turn to the other side of
Harnack's ‘ Dublette,' and venture with all diffidence to ask
whether the half-century or 50 which embraces the names of
Clement, Hermas and Justin was really characterised by such a
monotonous uniformity of system and doctrine as is supposed, and
whether it is true that the Epistle of James is of the same colour
or want of 60101112 It would take too long to compare together
the several writings which are assigned to this period. A mere
