Π 1-13 RESPEOT OF PERSONS 207

does not altogether deny to the rich a place in the Church, yet he
agrees with his Master and with St. Paul in regarding the pursuit of
money and the possession of wealth as greatly inci-easing the difficulty
of entering the kingdom of heaven (ii. 6, 7, iv. 13—16). On the
other hand a special blessing attaches to the poor.

The question here arises whether, if wealth is thus detrimental and
poverty favoni-able to our highest interests, we should not take steps
to diminish the one and increase the other. The writer of our Epistle
had himself witnessed the experiment of socialism tried at Jerusalem in
the first Pentecostal enthusiasm of the Church. The frequent sub-
scriptions in aid of the Church at Jerusalem, to which St. Paul refers,
have been regarded as an indication that the experiment proved a
failure from an economical point of view. At all events it does not
appear to have been continued for any length of time. Subsequently
this view of the comparative advantages of poverty and wealth had
great influence on the development of the Mediaeval Church : privatus
illis census erat brevis, comimme magynum; but this did not extend to
the secular order of things. Perhaps it may have been reserved to
our age, by legislative euactment, as well as by moral and religious
suasion, af any rate to limit the two extremes. We cannot doubt
that St. James would have approved of what has already been done
by the state in England to ameliorate the condition of the poorer
part of the community by means of factory bills, free education‚ free
libraries, extended franchise, &Q nor that he would have sympathized
with the efforts which are now being made to give the workman a
larger share of the profits of labour, and ensure to honest industry a
comfortable old age. And as regards the other extreme, it seems
natural to assume that he would have approved of a more cai-eful
circumscription of the supposed rights of property and also of any
measures‚ consistent with justice, which would tend to check the
concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, such as a graduated
scale in the income—tax and the death duties. Outside of the action
of the state there will still remain plenty of scope for the influence
of the Ohurch in drawing classes together, making them realize more
the tie of brotherhood, discountenancing wasteful sels-indulgence, not
less in the smoking and betting and drinking of the poor than in the
luxurious living of the rich, compelling all to recognise their responsi-
bility to God for-the use of the talents He has entrusted to them,
fostering such a tone of public feeling as would make it a disgrace for
men to spend their money or energy merely 011 their own pleasures
or interests, and would encourage them to vie with one another in the
promotion of art and science and literature, in making the world
happier and better and more beautiful than they found it, in a word,
in the advancement of God's kingdom upon earth.

One word as to the kind of honour which St. J ames would have us
pay to the poor. It is not of course that we are to flatter them, now
that they have become the depositaries of power, with a view of
gaining popularity and power ourselves. This would indeed be to
act from the ‘sinister motives' (διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν) which
