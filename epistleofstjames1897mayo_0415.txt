Fabricius' teAt of Sext. Emp. Hyp. ii. 1113, 111. 37. Τ1113 use may have
arisen from a wish to distinguish between ἄν qualifying a relative,
and ἅν qualifying the optative or indicative. As the former frequently
introduced a quasi-hypothetical proposition, it was not unnatural to
mark it by the addition of a hypothetical particle, particularly as
this had already become nearly otiose in such phrases as κᾶν εἰ, ὥσπερ
ἂν εἰ, while on the other hand ἄν itself was often used as equivalent
to ἐάν. Βουληθῇ (‘ makes it his aim ’) is important, since a Demetrius
may have ‘good report of all men as well as of the truth itself,' but
no man who makes worldly success his aim can be also a friend of
God. Compare Plut. illor. 6 τὸ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀρέσκειν τοῖς σοφοῖς ἐστιν
ἀπαρέσκειν.

modes⁷ of citation. For the personification see Lightfoot on Gal. iii. 8.
To show the incompatibility of being at the same time friends with
the world and friends of God, the writer refers to the mode of speaking
common in the O.T. where jealousy is ascribed to God.
