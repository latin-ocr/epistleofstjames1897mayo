cxxx INTRODUOTION

have inyself referred to the same passage, as proving that the writer
shared the belief expressed by St.. Paul 111 1115 earlier Epistles as to
the immediate Coming of the Lord. It is in strong contrast with
the language used in 2 Peter iii. 3, 8: ‘Knowing this, that in the
last times inockers shall come...saying Where is the promise of his
coming? for from the days that the fathers fell asleep all things
continue as they were fron] the beginning of the creation ’τ ‘But
forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.² It seems to
me that the words of St. James, while they prove his own expecta-

tion of the speedy appearance of the Lord, do not at all disprove ἡ

the same expectation 011 the part of those whom he addresses. A
inan might easily be impatient under continued ill-treatment, even
though he believed, as an abstract dogma, that the ‚Judge was soon
to appear. St. J ames urges him to make it a living truth, affecting
his daily practice. A fourth argument is that founded on the
discussion about saith and works, which, in Dean Farrar’s opinion,
‘ finds its most reasonable explanation in the supposition that he
is striving to remove the dangerous inferences to which St. Paul's
doctrine of justification by saith was liable.' The difficulty as to the
absence of any reference to the subject debated in the 001111011 of
Jerusalem is got over by the assumption that ‘the circumcision
question was speedily forgotten.' On these points Ι have already
said all that I think necessary.l

I turn now to other arguments adduced by Dr. Davidson. He is

11 0 of opinion that ‘ the direction to send for the elders of the Ohurch,
n and their use of 011 with the prayer of faith, savours of a post-
ous apostolic time? Why? The Apostles made use of 011 111 healing
y the sick (Mark vi. 13), and any J ewish community would be under

the direction of elders. But ‘ the office of elder was originally con-

m' fined to the Church's outer guidance,' and here ‘the office of elder-

ship is separated from the members of the Church, a thing which
did not exist in primitive Christianity.' The meaning 15 not very
clearly expressed. If certain members of the Church were chosen
to hold the office of elder, they were ipso facto separated from the
other members of the Ghurch3 and spiritual functions are certainly
implied in 1 Thess. v. 12-14„ 1 Pet. v. 2, and in Acts xx. 17 and 28.
The passage in St. James seems to imply an earlier condition of
things, for he there enjoins mutual confession and prayer.
