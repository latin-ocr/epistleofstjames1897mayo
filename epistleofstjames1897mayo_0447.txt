v 14] Notffls 167

The Roman Catechism adds that it is only to be administered to those
who are dangerously ill, that the oil is to be applied to those parts of
the body ’ἱη quibas potissimum sentiendi vis eminet, eyeS‚ ears, nose,
mouth, hands, feet, renes etiam velati voluptatis et libidinis sedes. Pastors
must instruct their people that by this sacrament venial sins are
remitted, the soul is freed from the weaknesses contracted by sin, and
filled with courage, hope, and joy. If bodily health does not now
follow 113, this is to be ascribed to the want of faith of those who
administer or receive the sacrament. In the form of Visitation for
the Sick, 111 the English Prayer-book of 1549, anointing was allowed if
the sick person desired it: ‘then shall the priest anoint him on the
forehead or breast only, making the sign of the Cross and saying thus ’
(a prayer for the inward anointing of the soul and for a restoration
of bodily health).

As regards the Greek Church Dr. King says (Rites ancl Ceremonies
of tlte Greek Cllurclc in Bassia, 1772, p. 305) ‘ though the Greek Ohurch
reckons 113 (the anointing of the sick) in the number of her myster-ieS,
yet it is certain there is nothing throughout the whole office which
implies that it should be administered only to persons periculose aeyro-
taatihas et mortis periculo imminente, as is prescribes] in the Roman
Church. On the contrary it may . . . be used in any illness as a pious
and charitable work, but not of necessity 3 and thence I presume the
doctors of this church maintain that this mystery 15 not obligatory or
necessary to all persons.'

It 15 curicus that there 15 110 note on this verse in Theophylact,
Euth. Zig„ or Cramer's (Utetur. Oecumenius on ἀλείψαντες ἐλαίῳ
refers simply to the miracles in 13116 Gospels without alluding 130 any
sacrament-al use of oil in his own day: τοῦτο καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου ἔτι τοῖς
ἀνθρώποις συναναστρεφομένου οἱ ἀπόστολοι ἐποίουν ἀλείφοντες τοὺς ἀσθε-
νοῦντας ἐλαίῳ καὶ ἰώμενοι. Bede in like manner speaks only of the use
of oil for healing bodily disease: lcoe et apostolos fecisse in Ευαπῃείἱο
legimus, et nanc Ecclesiae consuetudo tenet ‘at iasio-mi oleo consecrato
uayantar a presbysteris et oratione comitante amentur. IVec solum pres-
bysteris, sed, ut Innocentius papa scribit, etiam comibus Christianis uti
licet eodem oleo rin saa aut suoram necessitate unyem'lo, quocl tamen oleam
non ¹m'si ab episcopis licet confici. Nam (laocl ait, ‘Oleo in nomine
Domine',⁷ sigywficat oleam consecratam in nomiae Domini: vel ceo-te quia
etiam, cam anyzmt infirmam, nomen Domini saper eum invocare debent.
Luther’s opponent, Cardinal Cajetan, in his comment on this verse
denies that it has any reference to 13116 Sacramenta of Extreme Unction:
Tactus noa <licit ‘ I ›fil-msam· qais (al mortem ‚2 ' secl absolute ‘ Iusto-matur
qais? et eff'ectmn (licit infirmis alleviationem, et (le remissione pecca-
toram non nisi conditionaliter loquitur. . . . Praeter lcoc qaod ,Iacobus acl

ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου] In v. 10 we had the same phrase used of
the prophets only with the omission of the article before K. It is
probable however that the words τ. Κ., which are bracketed by WH.‚
are merely an explanatory gloss, as they are not found in B and are
