that, as far as we can judge‚ it was never contemplated by St.
J ames, and that there is no evidence of its use during the first
eight centuries by any except an obscure sect of Gnostics. There
are others who, while allowing that the belief in spiritual benefit to
be derived from Extreme Unction is a mere unauthorized fancy, are
still inclined 10 wink at it, as a means of tranquillizing the mind and,
preserving it from terrors as unreal and as superstitious as the remedy.
If a false theology has fastened on the mind the belief that God’s mercy
is limited to this life, and that after death He has no further compassion
for the sinner who has not repented and believed while on earth, but
is henceforth only the J udge and the Avenger, is it not allowable to
drive out one error by 6110111612 Τ116 question is far-reaching, but no
lover of truth can hesitate. Even at the last hour let the true Gospel
sound in the ears of the dying penitent‚ still more of the dying saint,
who is terrified by suspicions that he has not the right faith or the
true conversion. He who has once grasped the idea that Christ is
the propitiation for the sins of the whole world 3 that God's mercies
are everlasting over all His creatures; that He will do for each after
death exactly what perfect love and perfect wisdom dictate3 that
Eternal J ustice and Eternal Holiness, no less than Eternal Love, are
our guarantee against an eternity 01 evil, will have no need and no
wish for a material anointing.

CONFESSION or Su.

The connexion between suffering and sin was universally believed in,
and even exaggerated, when St. J ames wrote 3 as is evident from our
Lord’s words about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with the
sacrifices, and 6150 from the question of the disciples about 1116 man
who was born blind. St. Paul asserts that many were punished with
sickness and even with death for irreverence in receiving the Eucharist.
The J ewish proverb quoted in my note to the effect that ‘ a man could
not recover from sickness till his sins were forgiven' 15 quite in
accordance with our Lord's procedure in healing the sick of the palsy,
where the words ί8011, thy sins are forgiven thee' preceded the
command ‘Rise up and walk’ 3 and both enable us to understand why
confession and forgiveness are introduced here in the instructions
given for the healing 01 1116 sick.

There seems, however, to be a certain want of consecutiveness
in the language 01 St. James. We should have expected the con—
fession of sins to be mentioned before the forgiveness of sins, and
even before the prayer for healing, since healing, 65 we have seen,
was regarded as implying forgiveness, whereas is is brought in
afterwards as a second thought, though connected with what pre-
cedes by the inferenti-al particle οὖν. The emphatic ἀλλήλοις and
ἀλλήλων 01 v. 16 are decisive against the Romish limitation of
confession to the priest. Either the Elders mentioned in v. 14
have no special position distinguishing them from the other members
of the Church, or, more probably, we are to suppose that the duty
