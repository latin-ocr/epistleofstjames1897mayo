SPITTA ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE clxxi

⁴some further reference to the life and work of Christ, where it
seemed called for. Spitta answers this by citing the case of
4 Ezra vii. 228, where ‘Jesus’ is read in the Latin, instead of
‘ Messiah' read in the Syriae and other versions‚ also the Testa-
ment of Abraham, which closes with the Christian doxology. But
if we turn to Dr. James' edition of these apocryphal books, we
shall find that interpolation is by no means limited to these
passages 3 see his remarks on Test. Abr„ p. 50 foll. and 4« Ezra, p.
xxxix. I think therefore that the balance of probability is greatly
against the idea that a Christian wishing to adapt for Church use
the Hebrew treatise which now goes under the name of James,
would have been contented with these two alterations.

I turn next to the more general proofs adduced by Spitta to show
that the Epistle‚ setting aside the two verses in question, does not
rise above the level of pre-Christian Hebrew literature‚and that its
apparent connexion with other books of the New Testament is to
be explained either by a common indebtedness to earlier Hebrew
writings, or by the dependence of the other books on our Epistle.1
In like manner Massebieau, after giving an excellent analysis of
the argument, urges that not only does it make no distinct refer-
ence to the Christian scheme of salvation, but that it absolutely
excludes it. Salvation is wrought by the Word or the Trutb, the
Law of Liberty progressively realized by human effort aided by
Divine Wisdom. If this XVord, or this Wisdom, has deseended to
earth, it is not in the form of a distinct person, but as an infiuence,
an indwelling spirit, animating and guiding those who are begotten
from above, the elect heirs of the kingdom. If belief in Christ is
compatible with such a system of doctrine, it can only be belief in
Him as a Messiah preparing the way for the kingdom of God. He
is no longer essential to salvation. And if not recognised as
Saviour, neither is He recognised as Teacher. It is true there is
much in the Epistle which is also alleged to have been spoken by
J esus, but there is nothing to mark this as of special importance or
authority, like the citations froin the Old Testament. The words
of our Lord seem to stand on the same level with the writer's own
words. At times there appears even to be a contradiction between
the teaching of J esus and that of James, as when the latter tries to
excite the anger of his readers against the rich, who had maltreated
them, instead of reminding them that their duty was to love their
