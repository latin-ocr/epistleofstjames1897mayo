ΟΝ ΤΗΕ sTYLE OF ST. JAMEs ccxvii

I do not of course assert that St. James writes with the same
facility as St. Paul. The former was evidently a slow and careful
writer, while the latter speaks as he is moved, without regard to
accuracy or ornament, in the provincial Greek which was familiar
to him from childhood. Nor again is it meant that the Greek of our
Epistle is such as could be mistaken for that of a classica] writer.
There are undoubtedly harsh phrases, such as i. 17 τροπῆς ἁπο-
σκίασμα, 1. 23 τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς Γγενέσεως, ii. 4· κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν
πονηρῶν, and awkward and obscure sentences, such as ii. 1 μὴ ἐν
προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χρισ-
τοῦ τῆς δόξης, 111. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ «γλῶσσα καθίσταται
ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν ἡ . . . φλογίζουσα τὸν τροχὸν τῆς (γενέσεως,
111. 12 μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι; οὔτε ἁλυκὸν Γγλυκὺ
ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ, also iv. 5, 6, 17. But Schleiermacher and Dr. S.
Davidson are entirely mistaken when they allege as proofs that
‘the author was not accustomed to write Greek' such thoroughly
idiomatic phrases as i. 2 ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις,
and the admirably energetic βουληθεὶς 111 1. 18 (βουληθεὶς
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόνγῳ ἀληθείας). Nor can I see that there is any
ground for stumbling in the use of πορείαις 1111. 11 oros ἀπεκύησεν
111 1. 18. The latter, it 13 true, is not a classica] word, but the
question is not, of course, about classical, but about post—Classical
Greek, in which this word was of general use. If it is objected
that St. James uses, in the sense of ‘begettingj a word which
properly means ‘to bring forth,' the answer is that both here and
in i. 15 the word 13 used metaphorically, and that in the Hebrew
Scriptures terms properly employed of the mother are used to
denote God's relation towards mankind.

VOCABULARY.1

I proceed now to examine the vocabulary of St. James, giving
lists (1) of the words which are apparently used for the first time
by him, (2) of words used by him alone among biblical writers,
(3) of LXX. words employed by him alone among the writers of
the NT. It is stated in each case whether the word is classica]
or post-Classical, taking the year 300 B.O. as a rough dividing
line.

1 In making this list I have been materially assisted by the lists given in Thayer⁷s
Leoe'z'con and in Studia Bathea, i. p. 149.
