206 COMMENT

less courtesy than we have hitherto done towards the rich, provided
this courtesy proceeds from the right motive3 but it means that our
courtesy towards the poor should, if anything, be greater than our
courtesy towards the rich, partly because they have greater claims
upon us——the claims of the widow and orphan were noticed in the
previous verse—and partly because it may be more difficult for those
who have long been down-trodden 10 rise to their full dignity as
Christians, unless aided by our brotherly sympathy.

There are several questions which suggest themselves here. Does
St. J ames mean that all persons are 10 119 treated exactly in the same
way, irrespective of rank, age, sex, colour, creed‚ nationality, or the
special relations by which men are connected one with anotherZ Are
all these differences considered to belong not to the man himself, but
to the part he plays on the transitory stage of this morta] life? Is
it wrong to be influenced by such qualities as beauty, amiability,
cleverness‚ external refinement and good manners? Should our
behaviour towards one another be determined only by superiority
of moral excellence, as constituting the true 95591199 of the man?

This last distinction must of course in any case put a limit on the
injunction to ⁶ honour all men.' We are to honour man as man, but
not as coward or liar. It is the godlike, not the bestial or the
devilish, in man which deserves our honour. Yet seeing that these
elements are bound up in one individual, we must take care that the
stern repression which may be the treatment required for the worse
elements‚ does not entirely extinguish or conceal the reverence which
should be forthcoming for any manifestation of the higher nature in
the man. The reason given in the text for honouring the poor rather
than the rich, is that the latter are blasphemers and persecutors‚ the
former the inheritors of the kingdom of heaven. Nor again can we
suppose that St. James would disagree with St. Peter's injunction to
pay honour to the wife as to the weaker vessel, or that he would fail
to recognise the relative duties of parent and child, master and
servant, &c- Special honour is due to the king and the magistrate in
consideration of the office which they hold. While we give the first
place to moral goodness in whatever circumstances it may be found, it
is only natural and right to acknowledge with thankfulness God's
good gifts of mind or body, provided we are not led by them to con-
done or to think lightly of the moral defects by which they may be
accompanied. We cannot love all alike‚ nor can we honour all alike,
yet still honour and love are due to all who share the image of God
iii. 9 .
< We) come now to the actual case of respect of persons condemned
by St. James. Is it right to pay respect to wealth qua wealthCl It
may be right to respect it, in so far as it is the sign and result of'
honest skill and industry, or if it is used as a stewardship for the
good of others, but where it has been accumulated by withholding
his fair wages from the workman, and where it is used simply for the
purpose of selfish luxury, St. J ames has no measure in his indignant
denunciations (V. 1—6). On the whole we may say that, while he
