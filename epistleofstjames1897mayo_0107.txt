(2) Gospel <md Epistlcs (gs Sl. Jolm.1———'l*hougli our Epis-uo, does
not generally show such a close verbal agreement with the Uespe]
of St. John as it does with the Synoptie Guspels, yet there i>-
considerable resemblance in respect to 511011 genem] ideas as 1111·
World, the Truth, the Light, the Glory, 1110 New Birth, the Libertv
of Christ. No doubt the writings of St. John exhibit, 05 wi>
should expect, a far greater depth of thought and a 111010 advauced
Christianity than are to be found iu our Epistle; but, along with
this, there is a general harmony and community of ideas, such 05
might naturally result from remembrances of a common teaching,
or from continued association on the part of the two writers. lt
we come to the conclusion that in some cases 11115 similarity is
more easily explained by direct borrowing, it seems to 1110 that the
borrower is in all probability St. John. The richness and fulness
of expression in such passages as 1 John ii. 15, iii. 9, iii. 17, 21,
might easily grow out of the brief hints given in the parallels
of St. James, but it is scarcely conceivable that the latter
- should have deliberately disearded thoughts of such interest
and value, if he had had them in writing before him. The
same considerations will apply to the parallels to our Epistle
which are to be found in the writings of St. Peter and St. Paul.
Jt was easy for the latter, writing from a 111010 advanced standing-
point, to bring out and to emphasize the more distinctively
Christian doctrines which were still undeveloped and to some
extent latent in St. James. That St. Jaines should deliberately
have gone backwards, when those doctrines had once received
definite expression, is at any rate less probable. A further con-
sideration is that, if we allow a connexion between our Epistle and
those of the other Apostles, it is easier to explain this 011 1110 sup—
position that the latter were acquainted with the manifesto of the
President of the Church at Jerusalem, rather than on the supposi-
tion that he was acquainted with a variety of writings addressed to
distant Ghurches. , 11 15 10 be remembered also that these parallels
are not confined to the earlier or the more important Epistles of
St. Paul, and that some of the most striking parallels appear in
what are thought to be the latest writings in the N. T.‚ viz. the
