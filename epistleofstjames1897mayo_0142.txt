cxxii INTRODUOTION

notably by St. Peter and by St. Paul3 by the latter certainly in
his Epistles to the Romans and Galatians written in 58 and 57,
probably in his two Epistles to the Corinthians (57) and possibly
in his first Epistle to the Thessalonians (52).
(fflgrffig ἐξ, The results thus obtained are confirmed by a comparison of the
ζξζζξῧξξΐξξ, Epistle with contemporary history. If it had been written be-
tgngfieefflffiftween the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70) and the death of Clement
Jes1¹ss²²¹e¹¹¹⁷ (usually dated about ΑΒ. 95) it must inevitably have had some
reference to the preceding calamity in which so many Jews of·
the Dispersion had been involved. In our Epistle there is a
reference to tribulation, but this arises from the oppression and
persecution of the Christians by rich and prosperous Jews, who
are compared to beasts fattened for slaughter, and over whom it
is said that judgment is already impending: the writer is looking
forward, not backward. I need not say how utterly inappro-
priate such language would be, if addressed to the crushed and
broken remnant of the Jews in the years immediately following the
utter ruin of their city and temple and nation under Titus The
leaders of the persecution‚ the Sadducean hierarchy, had been
exterminated. The wealthier Jews in general, partly from the
hatred of their Gentile neighbours, partly from internal animosities‚
from desire of revenge for past ill-treatment, or from mere greed
and envy of the rich on the part of the poor, had been plundered
of everything in the reign of terror which prevailecl, alike in
Jerusalem itself and generally throughout the East, wherever Jews
were to be found. If here and there a solitary individua] had
succeeded in saving some fraction of his former possessions‚
certainly he had no longer the power to persecute others.
adssiisscs’iffleor A second mark of time in the Epistle is its silence as to the
(ξζὲᾏῑξζξξζξ) existence of Gentile Christians and the conditions on which
Gentiles should be admitted into the Church. If it was written
after the violent agitation caused by St. Paul's preaching to the
Gentiles and after the decision of the Council of Jerusalem (51)1‚ it
must surely have contained some reference to these events. It is
impossible to suppose that St. J ames, who was responsible for the
compromise agreed to at the Council, and who refers to it subse-

(1897) throws back the dates of Paul’s life generally, putting his conversion in the
year following the Crucifixion, and his martyrdom in 64, the Apostolic Council being

assigned to the year 47. Prof. Ramsay thinks it took place in the end of 49 (Paul
the Traveller, p. 153.)
