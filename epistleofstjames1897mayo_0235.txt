ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES ccxv

ταῦτα πάντα ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ μεγάλου ζῴου δόξαις, Stallb. on Rep.
v. 470); V. 14 after προσεύχομαι (cf. Mark xvi. 18 ἐπὶ ἀρρώστους
χεῖρας ἐπιθήσουσιν, Αο13 viii. 17, Αο13 ix, 17, but more usually
with dat. as 111 Mark v. 23, vii. 30).

πρόςε for the post-classical phrase πρός ὀλίγον iv. 14, cf. Plut.
Allor. 116 A, Justin M. Apol. i. 12 οὐκ ἄν τις τὴν κακίαν πρὸς
ὀλίγον ἡρεῖτο. There is only one instance of πρός with gen. in
N.T. (Acts xxviii. 34), and six with the dat.; but the acc. is some-
times used where we might have expected παρά with dat, as in
Matt. xiii. 56 αἱ ἀδελφαὶ πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰσίν.

ε’ν; the following are unclassical‚ λαλεῖν and ἀλείφειν ἐν τῷ
ὀνόματι v, 10, 14, πλούσιος ἐν πίστει i. 6 (where a Classical writer
would rather have used the simple gen. or dat), καυχάσθω ἐν τῷ
ὕψει 1. 9 (where a classical writer would rather have used ἐπί), ἐν
τῇ γλώσσῃ εὐλογεῖν iii. 9 (instead of the simple dat). These
uses are shared by the 011101· writers of the N.T.

Tonsos (md Rhoda—We have examples of the idiomatic use of
tenses in the gnomic aorist, i. 11, 24, and the juxtaposition of aor.
and perf. in i. 24 κατενόησε καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν and of the pres. and
perf. in iii. 17 δαμάζεται καὶ δεδάμασται. The use of the moods
also conforms to the classical standard except that the optative is
absent, as it is also in Matthew, the Gospel and Epistles of
John, and the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Apocalypse. We
have no instance in our Epistle of such constructions as ἵνα
followed by a fut. ind„ which we find in John xvii. 2 ἵνα δώσει,
1 Ρο1. iii. 1 ἵνα κερδηθήσονται, and frequently 111 1110 Apocalypse ;
still less of ἵνα with pres. ind. as in 1 Cor. iv, 6 ἵνα φυσιοῦσθε,
Gal. iv. 17 ἵνα ζηλοῦτε, though it is possible that these forms may
be used by mistake either for pres. subj. or fut. ind. (Winer p. 363)
A similar license is the use of ἐάν with indic. in 1 Thess. iii. 8 ἐὰν
ὑμεῖς στήκετε, Αο13 viii. 31 ἐὰν μή τις ὁδηγήσει, Luke xix. 40 ἐὰν
οὗτοι σιωπήσουσιν, 1 John V. 15 ἐὰν οἴδαμεν ; of ὅταν with indic.
Apoc. iV. 9 ὅταν δώσουσιν, Mark xi. 19 ὅταν ἐγένετο, ver. 25 ὅταν
στήκετε, Mark iii. 11 ὅταν ἐθεώρουν. Again, St. J ames affords no
instance of unclassical uses of the infinitive‚ such as ἐγένετο...
ἐλθεῖν, 30 common in Luke3 nor of the gen. of the article with inf.
instead of the simple inf. as in Luke xvii. 1 ἀνένδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ
τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ ἐλθεῖν, Acts iii. 11 πεποιηκόσι τοῦ περιπατεῖν ;
1101 of ἵνα with subj. instead of simple inf. as in Matt. xviii. 6
