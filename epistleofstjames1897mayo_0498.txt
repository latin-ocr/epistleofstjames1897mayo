ΤΗΕ WORLD.

The term κόσμος 15 borrowed from the Greek philosophers who used it
to express, first, the divine order apparent in the universe, and then the
actual universe and especially the heavenly bodies. ln the pantheistic
system of the 800105 0119 κόσμος 105911 was deified. By the writers of
the N. T. it is generally used in a dyslogistie sense. Thus 80, James
(i. 27) bids his readers ‘keep themselves unspotted from the world’
In ii. 5 he speaks of those who were ‘ poor in the view of the world '
as being ‘rich in saith) In iii. 6 119 speaks of the tongue as the
organ of the unrighteous world in our body. Here he says ‘ the
friendship of the world is enmity with God.' 80. John (1 Ep. ii.
15-17) analyses the influence of the world into the ‘lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eyes and the pride of lifes He tells us further (iii. 1)
that the world knew not God and therefore knows not the sons of
God3 (iii. 13) that the world hateth γοα, (iv. 5) that false prophets
are of the world and the world hears them3 (v, 4) ‘ whatever is
begotten of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory which
overcometh the world, even our faith ' 3 (v, 19) ‘ the whole world lieth
in wickedness ' (01 ‘in the evil one ') 3 (iii. 17) ‘ the world’s good' is
used in the same 591159 as ‘the unrighteous Manatum! 80 111 1115
Grospel we read (xiv. 17) that ‘ the world cannot receive the Comforter ' 3
(xiv. 30) ‘the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me ⁷ 3
(xv. 19) ‘ If ye were of the world the world would love its own, but I
chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.' So
St. Paul ‘ the world through its wisdom knew not God ' (1 Cor. i. 21) 3
‘ Grod chose the base things of the world' (1 Cor. i. 27) 3 and 80. Ρ9091
‘ that ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped
the corruption which is in the world through lust ' (2 Ρ90. i. 4). It is
evident that in these passages the world 15 used not for the external
universe, but for the world of men, that same world of which ‘we are
told that God so loved it, that he sent his Son that the world through
him might be saved (Joh. iii. 16, 17>3 and yet St. James says that one
who loves the world thereby becomes an enemy of God. How are we
to explain ‘chisil What is the exact nature of that world which 15 so
dear to God, and so dangerous to man?

Ε In the simplest sense of the word, the world 15 each man's natural
environment, that into which he enters at birth, and from which he
departs in death. It is the immediate present, the seen and temporal,
of which our senses bear witness, in contrast to the unseen and eternal 3
as 80. John says ‘ the world passeth away and the lusts thereos, but he
that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.' It supplies 0119 objects of
