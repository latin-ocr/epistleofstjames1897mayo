ment derived from St. Paul's words must be one of great force if
it is to overthrow the combined evidence of so many passages, all
showing that Christ's brothers were not included in the Twelve.
The words on which Jerome lays stress, as proving that J ames Examination

of the text

was one of the Twelve, are found in Gal. i. 18, 19, ἀνῆλθον αξὶξὲιὲῗὲθῗυ

εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ἱστορῆσαι Κηφᾶν καὶ ἐπέμεινα πρὸς αὐτὸν Meffig- of
ἡμέρας δεκάπεντε· ἕτερον δὲ τῶν ἀποστόλων οὐκ εἶδον, εἰ μὴ Geglwiv ᾖ
Ἰάκωβον τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ Κυρίου. Bishop Lightfoot in his ’“ ’
note discusses whether this should be translated, ‘ I saw no other-
Apostle save James,' or ‘ I saw no other Apostle, but only J ames?
He gives instances to show that εἰ μὴ may have the latter force,
eff. Luke iv. 27, πολλοὶ λεπροὶ ἦσαν ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἐλισαίου
τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἐκαθαρίσθη εἰ μὴ Νααμεὶν ὁ
Σύρος, Gal. ii. 16, οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ἕρτγωυ νόμου ἐὰν μὴ
διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Apoc. xxi. 27, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς
αὐτὴν πᾶν κοινὸν καὶ ὁ ποιῶν βδέλυνγμα καὶ ψεῦδος, εἰ μὴ οἱ
«γεγραμμένοι ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τῆς ζωῆς, ib. ix. 4. The peculiarity of
these cases is that, whereas, according to the ordinary use, εἰ μὴ
introduces an exception to a general statement applicable to
the class to which the excepted case belongs, in the instances
cited the excepted case is not included in the foregoing class.
It appears to be originally a colloquial use, and is employed with
comic effect in Arist. Eq. 185, διο. Thus here Naaman was not
one of the many lepers in Israel; they who are written in the
Book of Life are not included among those who are guilty of
abomination and falsehood 3 saith is not included in the works of
the law, but is contrasted with them as a different kind of
justification. Accordingly, St. J ames need not be included in the
preceding Apostles. Much in the same way we find πλήν used,
where we should rather have expected ἀλλά, ορ. Acts xxvii. 22,
ἀποβολὴ ’γὰρ ψυχῆς οὐδεμία ἔσται ἐξ ὑμῶν πλὴν τοῦ πλοίου.
But even if we give its usual force to εἰ μή, it will not follow that
St. James was included in the Twelve, for there can be no doubt
that in Gal. i. 19 ἕτερον looks backward to Κηφᾶν, not forward
to Ἰάκωβον. The sentence would have been complete at εἶδον,
‘I saw Peter and none other of the Apostles.’ Then it strikes
St. Paul, as an afterthought, that the position of J ames, as Presi-
dent of the Church at Jerusalem, was not inferior to that of the

Apostles, and he adds ‘unless you reckon J ames among them.'
