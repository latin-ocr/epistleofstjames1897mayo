CHAPTER XII

APPARATUs CRITICUS1

GREEK MANUSCRIPTS

I. Manuscripts written in large capitals (chials)
Fourtlz Ceoztwrgy

B. CODEX VATICANUS. No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at
Rome. Written continuously without breathings or accents.
Stops are rare, but a full stop is sometimes represented by a vacant
space. Probably contained all the canonical books of the Old and
New Testament; but almost the whole of Genesis, part of the
Psalms, the later Chapters of Hebrews, the Pastoral Epistles, Phile-
mon and the Apocalypse are now wanting. It is generally
regarded as the most valuable of all the MSS. containing a pure Pre-
Syrian text (WH. Intr. p. 150) and is not unfrequently followed
by Westcott and Hort against the other chief MSS„ compare
i. 9, 22, ii. 3, 19, 26, iv. 8, 9, 14, v, 7, 14, 20. Errors from
itacism are frequent, especially the confusion of αι and ε (as in ii.
14 κατακαυχατε, 24 ὁραται B1, iv. 6 ἀντιτασσετε, iv. 8 φευξετε
Bl, V. 7 ἐκδεχετε ΒῙ, V. 16 ἐξομολογεισθαι Bi, προσευχεσθαι El)
and the writing of ει for ι (as in i. 6 διακρεινομενος, ῥειπιζομενῳ, 11.
6 ἠτειμασατε, iii. 7 ἀνθρωπειυῃ, iv. 8 ὑμειν, iv. 14 ἀτμεις, v. 3 εἷος
