ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον.] Gen. XXii. 9 ἐπέθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσ. The
word, which is not found in classica] writers, is used 01 1116 Jewish
material altar or the Christian spiritual altar in the N.T., LXX., Philo,
Jooephus, and later writers. See Westcott, Hebrews, p. 453ff.

22. βλέπεις] Ι prefer, with WH.‚ to take this and ὁρᾶτε below V.
24 as a statement, not a question, both explaining γνῶναι in v. 20.
It is used with ὅτι in Heb. iii. 19, 2 Cor. vii. S.

συνήργει τοῖς ἕργοις.] ⁴ Faith cooperated with his actions and was per-
fected by them': cf. Mark xvi. 20 τοῦ Κυρίου συνεργοῦντος (sc. τοῖς
ἀποστόλοις), Rom. viii. 28, l Maec. xii. 1, Test. Issach. 3, Plut. illor. p.
138 Α. τῇ ψυχῇ συνεργεῖ τὸ σῶμα καὶ συγκάμνει, Philo M. 2, p. 616 αὐγὴ
τὸ ἀποστελλόμενον ἐκ φλογός, συνεργὸν ὀφθαλμοῖς εἷς τὴν τῶν ὁρατῶν
ἀντίληψιν. Here we have the opposite to χωρὶς ἔργων.

23, ἐτελειώθη.] Α6 1116 tree is perfected by its fruits, so faith by its
works. In like manner sin is spoken 01 (1. 15) 66 ἀποτελεσθεῖσα when
transformed into act and habit and so producing its natural result,
and ὑπομονή 16 exercised and made perfect by practice (i. 4). Wherever
there are good works, it is due to the saith which inspires them,
wherever there is genuine faith it must blossom into works, see l
John ii. 5.

ἐπληρώθη.] So Matt. ii. 17 ἐπληρώθη τὸ ῥηθέν κ.τ.λ. ‘the word of
›prophecy about Rachel then received its true fulfilment.' In the
sacrifice 01 Isaac was shown the full meaning of the word (Gen. XV. 6)
spoken thirty or (as the Rabbis say) fifty years before in commendation
01 Abraham’s belief in the promise of a child. When they were first
spoken Abraham's faith was imperfect, as is shown by the question
(Gen. xv. 8) ‘Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it‘l’ It
was the willing surrender 01 1116 child 01 promise, ‘ accounting that God
was able to raise him up from the dead,' which fully proved his 161111.
‘The Rabbis distinguish ten instances 01 161111 111 Abraham 31 his saith
was perfected in 1116 sacrifice 01 Isaac, his justification was proved by
his being acknowledged as friend 01 God. The Jews implore the mercy
01 God by 1116 sacrifice 01 Isaac, as Christians by the sacrifice 01 Christ.2

ἡ γραφή] The singular is used 01 6 particular passage, as in Mark xv.
28 ἐπληρώθη ἡ ’γραφὴ ἡλέγουσα καὶ μετὰ τῶν ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη.

ἐπίστευσεν ὃὲ.] The MSS. 01 1116 LXX. , with the exception 01 19 611(1
108, have καὶ ἐπίστευσεν, but δέ 16 found, instead of καὶ, in Philo M. 1.
p. 605, Rom. iv. 3, Clem. Rom. i. 10. 6, Justin M. Dial. 92, showing
that δέ was the then accepted reading (Hatch‚ p. 156).
Ϊὲλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς &scateo-ww] The original HebreW (Gen. XV. 6) has
the active, ‘ God counted it to him ' : the quotations in the N.T. (Rom.
iv. 3 1011, Gal. iii. 6) have the passive with the LXX. Similar phrases
occur Gen. vii. 1 (01 Νο611) σὲ εἶδον δίκαιον ἐναντίον μοῦ, Deut. vi. 25 ‘ it
shall be our righteousness (LXX. ἐλεημοσύνη) if we observe to do al]
