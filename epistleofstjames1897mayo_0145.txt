ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxv

the Divinity of Christ and the atonement wrought by Him for the
sins of the whole world, but the majority of Jewish Christians
between the day of Pentecost and the fall of Jerusalem were
probably even less advanced. They did not understand that the
former things had passed away, and that from henceforth neither
Jews nor Gentiles were bound by the Mosaic Law. The work of
‹James was to lead 011 111011, who were in this stage of religious
belief, to higher views, as they were able to bear it. He was
especially fitted for this work because he was so much in sympathy
with those whom he addressed. By nature slow 10 move, he had
from his childhood loved the Law, as the old psalmists did; 1110
Gospel itself was in his view 51111 1110 011010111 law, revealed at
length in its perfect form, and written in the mind and heart of
the believer‚ as J eremiah had prophesied. We are not of course
justified in assuming that his own belief was limited to what is set
down in the Epistle. He wrote doubtless what he believed would
be most useful for the majority of those whom 110 011111055011.
He could only appeal to motives which would 110170 force with
them, and build up 1115 arguments on premisses which they would
concede. This perhaps may account for his referring to the
example of Job and the prophets rather than of Christ. Sup-
posing, as was probably the case, that our Gospels were not yet in
existence, and that the Christian teaching of these Jews of the
Dispersion was founded on short collections of loqz'a, containing
parables and aphorisms of Christ, it is quite possible that the
details of his life may have been less familiar to them than the
Iessons from the Old Testament read to them in the synagogue
every Sabbath day. 81111 00011 year must have seen more of the
life and teaching of Christ set down in writing3 each year must
have left its impress on the mind of St. Ja1nes. One who so
strenuously did the Father’s will must have learnt more and more
of the doctrine, and received ever fuller revelation from the Spirit
of truth. 80 far as this consideration goes, we should be led to
⁴ assign the Epistle to the earliest possible date after the day of
Pentecost.
