because the passages are far from implying the extensive establish-
ment of Jewish-Christian churches immediately after Pentecost.
The earliest history contains no clear trace of such churches widely
scattered through the lands.' In answer we may say that un-
doubtedly there must have been such churches previously to the
admission of Gentiles into the Church‚ otherwise than as proselytes.
It was to persecute such a church that Saul went to Damascus
with authority from the high priest. Such were all churches
founded before the conversion of Cornelius, and the great majority
of churches founded before 51, except those founded by St. Paul.
There is just as little point in Dr. Davidson’s further remark that
' ‘the writer does not convey the impression that his knowledge of*
their condition was minute or specific, for his language is general,
such as a later author, writing in his name, would employ.' Of
course a circular letter cannot deal with persona] relations. Dr.
Davidson then states his own conclusion that it was written after
James's death, in his name, by a moderate Ebionite, shortly before
the destruction of Jerusalem.1 One does not quite see why the
moderate Ebionite should have been capable of writing in 68 the
letter which we havebeen just told it was impossible for St. J ames
to have written six years before. If the moderate Ebionite ‘occupied
a spiritual stage which J ames the Just hardly reached,' should we
not ‘naturally expect some mention of Christ's resurrection at
least'2 But these men in buckram, who are always at the dis-
posal of our modern critics, are wonderfully Protean in their
characteristics as in their powers.
Von Soden's Let us turn, however, from the halting and hesitating disciple

{iiiicissgdatrg We may take Von Soden as one of the latest representatives of the
fam school. Here is a summary of his Introduction to our Epistle‚ so
far as it relates to its date and authenticity‚ which is con-

tained in the HamZ-Kommentor sum N. T„ brought out under the

direction of Professors Holtzmann, Lipsius, and others, in 1890 :—

In thought and expression there is considerable resemblance between our
epistle and the writings of Clement of Rome, and especially of Hermas. There
is however no reason to suppose any literary connexion between them. They
resemble one another, simply because they were produced under the same con-
