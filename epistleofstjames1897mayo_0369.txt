ΙΙ 8-10] NOTES 89

that νόμος is ever used in the Bible of a particular precept Ξ ἐντολή.
'Phe ten commandments are never called οἱ δέκα νόμοι. But might not
St. James unconsciously pass from the collective sense of νόμος to the
particular precepts of which it consisted, without reflecting that,
strictly speaking, such a use of the term was illegitimatel The other
explanation is not without difficulty. We have plenty of examples of
the substantival use of the neuter ἔν 111 the nominative and accusative,
but not often in the other cases. See however i. 4 ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι.

γέγονεν πάντων ἔνοχος] For perfect following aorist see above i. 211.
Ἔνοχος (lit. ‘in the power of') is used with a genitive of the offence
-(‘ guilty of theft ’)‚ of the punishment (ἐν. θανάτου Matt. xxvi. 66), of
the law sinned against, as here. It takes a dative of the tribunal.
Πάντων is equivaleni] to ὅλου τοῦ νόμου.

The first reference here seems to be to those who fail in the one
point of προσωπολημψία, though they may claim to keep the rest of the
laxv3 but there is a more general reference to the man who, thinking
himself to be religious (i. 26), assumes that all is right with him,
like the Pharisee in the parable (Luke xviii. 11). ‘Some of the Rabbis
actually laid it down that obedience to certain laws‚ eg. the law about
fringes and phylacteries‚ was as good as obedience to the 1ν11016.1 Cf.
Midrash Mishle on Prov. i. 10 qui ιιηιιιη praeceptum Servat est ac si
totam leym servasset. On the other hand, the principle here affirmed
by St. James is also to be found in the sayings of the Rabbis : thus
Schegg gives a story from a Midrash on Numbers ; 2 ‘ R. Hunna having
taught his disciples that he who committed adultery broke all the
commandments, was asked by them to explain how this could be true
of the fourth commandment ' 3 and XVetstein to the same effect quotes
two sayings of R. Jochanan from Sabb. f. ΤΟ. 2 si faciat omnia, 'cenum
vero omittat, omnium et sinqulormn reus* est ‚· and Pesikta f. 50. 1 omnis
qui dicit, totam {essem 690 ‘ln me recipio prs-aeter verbum unum, laic sefr-
monem Domini sprevit ec praecepta ejus irrita fecit, Hor-aioth S b ;
(Levit. V. 6) R. Jose Galz'lcceus dixit .· ‘qui reus est unius, reus est
onmiw)2‚' Cf. 4 istaec. 5. 18 μὴ μικρὰν εἶναι νομίσῃς ταύτην, εἰ μιαρο-
φαγήσαιμεν, ἁμαρτίαν· τὸ γὰρ ἐπὶ μικροῖς καὶ μεγάλοις παρανομεῖν ἷσοδύναμόν
ἐστιν, δι’ ἑκατέρου ’γὰρ ὁμοίως ὖπερηφανεῖται, and Test. Xii. Patr. 689 ἄλλος
κλέπτει, ἀδικεῖ, ἁρπάζει, πλεονεκτεῖ, καὶ ἐλεεῖ τοὺς πτωχούς. διπρόσωπον μὲν
τοῦτο, τὸ δὲ ὅλον πονηρόν ἐστιν, Cellerier cites Bas-il. Bapc. ii. 9 παρά-
νομός ἐστιν ὁ μίαν ἐντολὴν παραβάς.

This passage of St. James is discussed at length by Augustine in a
letter to Jerome (Ep. 167). He compares the tcaching of St. James
with the Stoic doctrine on the ‘ solidarity ⁷ of the virtues and vices, as
to Which see Stob. Ecl. ii. p. 112 τὸν μίαν ἔχοντα ἀρετὴν πάσας ἔχειν, Καί
τὸν κατὰ μίαν πράττοντα κατὰ πάσας πράττειν, ib. 116 φασὶ δὲ καὶ πάντα
ποιεῖν τὸν σοφὸν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀρετάς· πᾶσαν γὰρ πρᾶξιν τελείαν αὐτοῦ

1 [See Shemoth Rabb. xxv. end : ‘ the Sabbath weighs against all the precepts ' ;
if they kept it, they were to be reckoned as having done all: if they profaned it,
as having broken all. Rashi on Numbers xv. 3840 says the same of the law of
Fringes, but an integral part of this is to reinember all the 001nma11dments.—C. T.]
