III 13-15] NOTEs 123

ὀρθοῦται. It is used by St. Paul, Phil. 1. 17 οἱ δὲ ἐριθείας τὸν Χριστὸν
καταγγέλλουσιν, Rom. ii. 8, Gal. V. 20 ἔρις, ζῆλος, θυμοί, ἐριθεῖαι,
διχοστασίαι where Lightfoot translates ‘caballings’), and the same list
in 2 Cor. xii. 20, except that καταλαλιαί stands for διχοστασίαι, l'hil. i.
17 μηδὲν κατ’ ἐριθείαν, μηδὲ κατὰ κενοδοξίαν, ἀλλὰ τῇ ταπεινότητι ἀλλήλους
ἡγούμενοι ὑπερέχοντας ἑαυτῶν, imitated in Ignat. Plailad. S μηδὲν κατ’
ἐριθείαν πράσσειν. It is possible that the later meaning may be coloured
in the N.T. by areminiscence of the earlier meaning : cf. Joh. x.‚ where
the spirit of the hireling is contrasted with that of the true shepherd.
The verb is used in its original sense of spinning Tobit ii. 11 (mid.)
ἦ γυνή μου ἠριθεύετο ἐν τοῖς γυναικείοις καὶ ἀπέστελλε τοῖς κυρίοις, Heliod.
i. 5 (acb.) αἱ γυναῖκες ἐριθεύουσιν.

μὴ κατακαυχᾶσθε] This verb was used above (ii. 13) with gen. to
denote the triumph of one principle over another, and so in the only
other passage where it occurs in N.T.‚ Rom. xi. 17 μὴ κατακαυχῶ τῶν
κλάδων. Three other instances of its use are cited, all from the LXX„
Zech. X. 12 κατισχύσω αὐτοὺς ἐν Κυρίῳ καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ κατακαυχήσον-
ται, and Jer. 1. (xxvii.) 11 and 38, where the verb is used absolutely,
κατά having only an intensis-ying force, as in κατακτείνω, κατάδηλος.
The question whether it should be thus taken here will be considered
in connexion with the following clause.

ψεύδεσθε κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας] If you have bitterness you cannot be truly
wise, for Wlsdom is shown by gentleness; your profession therefore is
alie: ef. 1 John 1. 6 ἐὰν εἴπωμεν ὅτι κοινωνίαν ἔχομεν μετ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν
σκότει περιπατῶμεν, ψευδόμεθα καὶ οὐ ποιοῦμεν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, il). iv. 20,
Wisd. Vi. 25 φθόνος οὐ κοινωνήσει σοφίᾳ. Some (VViesinger, Hofmann)
take τῆς ἀληθείας to mean the Gospel, as above i. 18, explaining it of
false teachers‚ blind leaders of the blind, who, like those referred to in
1 Cor. i. 18—23, speak contemptuously of the Gospel and misrepresent
its doctrines. Perhaps it is simpler to understand it of ‘ the facts of
the case‚' as in Mk. V. 13 εἶπεν αὐτῷ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, for Which
Bloomfield compares Diod. i. 2 ἔνια κατεψεῦσθαι τῆς ἀληθείας, Jos. B.J.
prooem. 1 (former historians) καταψέυδονται τῶν πραγμάτων; (‘ you
claim to be enlightened Christians‚ but enlightenment joined with
bitterness and sels-seeking comes not from God, but from the devil.')
The expression is no doubt pleonastic ε it would have been enough to
say ‘your boast of wisdom is at variance With the truth,' but emphasis
is added by the fuller phrase, as in the passage quoted from St. John.
If we understand it thus it would seem that κατακαυχᾶσθε must be
taken absolutely (‘do not boast of wisdom and so lie against the
truth ') and not with κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας in the sense of ‘triumphing over
the truth! See however Zahn NJs. p. 792 oz.

15, οὐκ ἔστιν αὕτη ἠ σοφία ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη.] ‘ This Wisdom is not one ·
that descends from above,' see on ἄνωθέν ἐστιν καταβαῖνον 1. 17 3 and cf.
above i. 5, Philo M. 1. p. 571 σοφία ἄνωθεν ὀμβρηθεῖσα ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ, ib. p.
524, and on the opposition of θεία καὶ οὐράνιος σοφία 130 ἐπίγειος σοφία ib.
p.,51 f. and 1 Cor. i. 19 foll. esp. ii. 6 σοφίαν λαλοῦμεν ἐν τοῖς τελείοις,
σοφίαν δὲ οὐ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου ( = ἐπίγειον)...ἀλλὰ λαλοῦμεν σοφίαν Θεοῦ
κ.τ.λ. This false wisdom is described in Sir. xix. 19 foll.
