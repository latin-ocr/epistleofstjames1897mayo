170 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

to a formal confession of sin, but merely to such mutual confidences
as would give a right direction to the prayers offered by one for
the other z so Augustine, commenting on this verse (Truct. 58 in Jolicm.
quoted by Bingham, l.c.)‚ and Bede quotidiana leviaque peccata alteo·-
utrum coaequalibus coifitectmur eorumque quotidiam credamus oratioue
salvcw·i; though the latter adds gyravioris sepo-(ie 'immunditiam juata
legsem sacerdoti paudoemus (itque (iil ejus arbitrium qualiter et quanto
tempore jusserit purificare curemus. The Greek commentators have no
nofe here. Origen (Hom. ixi. in I's. n:.roevii., Lomm. xii. p. 266) points
out the use of such confession and at the same time recommends
cantion in choosing the person to whom confession should be made.
He does not limit the selection to presbyters, though they would
naturally be thought of, and are generally specified by later writers on
the subject.

Some of the Romish controversialists, as Bellarmine, cited by Hooker
vi. 5, maintain that St. James in this passage alludes to auricular con-
fession, but Cajetan again speaks the language of common sense: uec
hic est sermo (Ze emises-sione sacrmnentali (ut patet esa: eo quod dicit ‘ con-
fitemini iitrz'cem’ ,· sacramentalis enim cuitjessio ozon fit invicem, secl sacer-
dotibus tantum), sed (Ze coqfessioue qum mutuo fatemur uos peccatores ut
oretur prro uobis, et de confessione hinc et inde erratorum pro mutua
placatione et reconciliatione. The practice of auricular confession was
not made generally obligatory even by the Church of Rome till the
Lateran Council of 1215 under Innocent ΠΙ., which ordered that every
adult person should confess to the priest at least once in the year. In
all other Churches it is still optional. Mutual confession was an early
custom in monasteries,1 and the Moravian Societies (which Wesley
took as the pattern for the Methodist Classes) used to meet two or
three times a week ‘ to confess their faults one to another and to pray
for one another that they might be healed.' The word Exomologesis
was borrowed by the Latin Christians, cf. Tertull. Orat. 7. For further
information see articles on Exomologesis and Penitence in D.O.A.
