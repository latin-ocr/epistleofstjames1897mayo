ning of spiritual life to our regeneration by the word of truth (i.
18)—and how can we receive that word except through the
instrumentality of faith 2—he seems to me to rate saith as highly
as St. Paul himself. Yet even St. Paul sets saith below love, and
goes so far as 10 say, ‘Though I have all saith so as to remove
mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing.’

I really cannot see that Pfieiderer has anything else in the way
of argument to offer for his view. All that he tells us is that
towards the middle of the second century the Catholic Church had
very much lost its hold of distinctive doctrine, that it was secular
in tone, and was occupied in controversy With the Gnostics, to
whom he considers that allusion is made by James, where he
condemns a psychical and diabolical wisdom‚ and speaks against
those who judge the law, and who impute to God the blame for
their wrong-doing. If it were certain that the epistle dated from
this time, we might be justified 111 supposing such allusions, but as
all probability is against it, we have no reason to go so far to
explain references which would be applicable in any age. The
only difficulty would be in the term ψυχικάς, but this is already
used in the first Epistle to the Corinthians.

VVithout entering into any discussion as to the correctness of
Pfleiderer's estimate of the state of Christianity under the Anto-
nines, and without repeating the positive argument for the early
date of James, I will simply mention here some characteristics of
the Epistle which seem to me inexplicable on the hypothesis of
the date given by Pfleiderer. The first, already noticed by
Beyschlag, relates to the heading, ‘ J ames the servant of God.’ It
is quite consistent with the modesty which marks the Epistle
throughout, that James himself should adopt this humble title3
but is it conceivable that a late writer, wishing to secure a hearing
by the adoption of a famous name, should throw away all the
distinguishing adjuncts, Apostle, Bishop of Jerusalem, Bishop of
Bishops, Brother of the Lord, and call himself plain J ames, a name
which could attract no attention and excite 110 interest? Would
the Church of Rome have submitted patiently to the extremely
severe reproofs of this unknown James? Would there be any
appropriateness in speaking of the odola, as dragging the believers
before the law-courts and blaspheming the noble name by which
they were called? Would the thoroughly Hebraic tone of the Epistle,
