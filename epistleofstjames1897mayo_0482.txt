But 11 we have no difficulty in finding cases in which we should all
echo the admonition 01 St. James3 if we should allow that for the
Jews 01 his time, as 101· certain races in our own time, the rule ‘slow
10 speak' might be of very general application3 do we not also find
cases, especially in England, where a stimulus is needed in the opposite
direction2 Is there not sometimes a stolid absence of interest both in
persons and things, which does away with the chief motive for conver-

Stoic apathy, any more than ‘slow 10 speak' is 10 be understood as
