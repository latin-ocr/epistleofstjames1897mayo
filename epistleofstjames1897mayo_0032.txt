xii INTRODUCTION

sidered the Lord's brethren to be sons of Joseph’s by a former
wife, as ‘ following the ravings of the apocryphal writings, and in-
ventlng a certain Melcha or Escha’ (for Joseph's first wife).

,Ι think that these facts prove that the belief in the Perpetual
Virginity, which was growing up during the second century and
established itself in the third century, was founded, not upon historic
evidence, vbut simply on sentimental groundS, which may have
gained additional strength from opposition to the Ebionites, who
denied the miraculous birth of the Lord (Iren. iii. 21, Orig. ο. Cels.
V. 61). Even by Basil the Great, who died in 379 A.D., this belief
is held, not as a necessary article of saith, but merely as a pious
opinion,l ‘ since the lovers of Christ cannot endure to hear that the
mother of God ceased to be a virgin.' Bp. Lightfoot (lc. p. 285)
adds that ‘as immediately afterwards he refers, in support of his
view, to some apocrypha] work, which related that Zacharias was
slain by the Jews for testifying to the virginity of the mother of
J esus (a story which closely resembles the narrative of His death
in the Protev. ἕξ 23, 24), it may perhaps be inferred that he
accepted that account of the Lord's brethren which ran through
these apocryphal Gospels.' It is unnecessary to give the names of
others who held that the ‘brethren' were sons of Joseph by a
former wife.2 The chief supporter of this view is Epiphanius, who .
wrote against the Antidicomarianitae about the year 370 A.D. The

view of Tertullian was reasserted by Helvidius, Bonosus, and
Jovinianus, about the year 380 A.D.

B. Jerome's answer to Helvidius, which fastened on the Western
Church the doctrine of the Perpetua] Virginity and the interpreta-
tion of ‘ brethren ⁷ in the sense of ‘ cousins,' appeared about 383 A.D.
Helvidius had attacked the prevailing view of the superiority
