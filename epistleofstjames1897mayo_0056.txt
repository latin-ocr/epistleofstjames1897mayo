to the nurture and training of Jesus. On the other hand, the
greatest prophets and saints had not been brought up in solitude.
Moses, Samuel and David had had brothers and sisters. It might
be God's will that the Messiah should experience in this, as in
other things, the common lot of man. Whichever way the Divine
guidancc might lead them, we may be sure that the response of
Mary would be still as before, ‘Behold the handmaid of the Lord,

be it unto me according to thy word?

brothers of the Lord, living with his mother and in constant

when St. Matthew goes into what we might have been inclined

Βέῗηῑῖ (J.wa The conclusion then, to which our discussion leads, is that J ames
the Lord's brother was son of J oseph and Mary, brought up with
J esus until his eighteenth year at any rate, not one of the Twelve,
not even a disciple till the very end of our Saviour's life, but con-
vinced, as it would seem, by a special appearance to him of the
risen Lord, and joining the company of the disciples before the day
of Pentecost. After the martyrdom of Stephen, when the Apostles
were scattered from Jerusalem, we find J ames holding a position of
authority in the Church of Jerusalem (Gal. i. 18, 19, Acts xii. 17), ,ᾖ
which, 00 we may probably conjecture, had been conceded to him i

as brother of the Lord, and retaining this position till the end of 4³¹

his life. ⁴'
