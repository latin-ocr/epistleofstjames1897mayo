HARNACK ΑΜ) SPITTA oN THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE

TWO important works have recently appeared, in which very
opposite views are taken as to the date of the Epistle of St. James.
One is Dio Olmvofnsoloqz'c (les altelwzssszliclzen L‘z'ttcratur bis Eusebius,
brought out this year (1897) by the distinguished theologian,
Adolf Harnack: the other, F. Spitta's learned and acute cont-ribu-
tion, Zur Gcselzwzsselzto und Littcs‘atur des Urelzristentlzwns‚ vol. ii.,
1896, of which 239 pages are occupied with a very careful study of
the Epistle. Ι take them in this order because Harnack on this
particular book still adheres to the old T'ubingen tradition, from
which he has receded in regard to many of the other documents of
the New Testament, while Spitta occupies an entirely independent
position. As Harnack only devotes six pages to the subject, and
refers to Jiilicher’s Ez‘nlaz‘tmzsq, 1894, as supplementing his argu-
ment, Ι have joined thern together in the discussion which follows.

,Julicher begins (p. 129) with a general attack upon the authen-
ticity of the Catholic Epistles. They are not really epistles at all;
there is nothing personal about them3 the epistolary form was
simply adopted, by a stranger writing to strangers, in imitation of
thc widely-circulated epistles of St. Paul. This is enough to prove
that they are post-Pauline, and therefore not written by any of the
Apostles (‘ damit ist schon gesagt dass sie erst aus nachpaulinischen
Zeit, also nicht wohl von Uraposteln herrtihren konnen ³). Har—
nack also remarks on the fact that St. James reads more like a
homily than a letter, as casting doubt on its genuineness.

Are we to understand then that an epistle must be judged
spurious, if it 13 occupied with impersonal matter, or if it is a
sermon 01 treatise masking under this form? If so, we must deny
