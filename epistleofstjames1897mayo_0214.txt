cxciv IN TRODUOTION

while the absence of the article forbids us to make a new unit,
such as would be implied by ἡ τοιαύτη καύχησις. We find the
article in i. 8 ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ ‘in all his ways‚' and
with ὅλος in ii. 10 ὅλον τὸν νόμον, 111. 2 ὅλον τὸ σῶμα. More
rarely we find ὅλος placed after the article and substantive, as in
τὸν κόσμον ὅλον Mark viii. 36, In both these cases ὅλος is
properly in apposition, and is thus more forcible than when it
is placed between the article and substantive, as it sometimes is in
classical writings‚ but never in the N.T. Πᾶς however occurs in
this order in Acts xx, 18 τὸν πάντα χρόνον, Gal. v. 14 ὁ πᾶς
νόμος, &a

An adjective or participle may stand by itself as a substantive,
if its omitted subject is made sufficiently clear by gender, number,
and context, eg. Θεὸς ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται iv. 6, εἰδότι καλὸν
ποιεῖν.. ἁμαρτία ἐστίν iv. 17; and such a substantive may be
defined by the article like a proper substantive, eg. i. 6 ὁ διακρινό-
μενος, 1. 11 ὁπλούσιος, 11. 16 τὰ ἐπιτήδεια, 111. 11 τὸ νγλυκύ, τὸ
πικρόν. In like manner the infinitive, which is used by itself as a
substantive in apposition in i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ἐστίν,
ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς, may be defined by the article and thus
become capable of inflexion, as in τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι, v. 17. The same
holds good of adverbs or any other indeclinable word or phrase, as
in v. 12 ἤτω ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναί, where the article serves to dis-
tinguish the first ναί, which is subject, from the second ναί, which
is predicate. It has been stated above that a substantive may be
qualified by an adverb interposed between it- and the article, as
ἡ ἄνωθεν σοφία in iii. 17. If the noun is such as can be easily
supplied in thought, from its being part of a common phrase or ¹
any other reason, it is often omitted, as in ἡ αὔριον (ἡμέρα) iv. 13.
Again the neuter article is often used with the genitive to express
generally what belongs to the person or thing denoted, and thus
we get the phrase τὸ τῆς αὔριον in the verse referred to.

οὗτος used to emphasize the apodosis in i. 23 εἴ τις ἀκροατὴς...
οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρί κ.τ.λ, i. 25 ὁ παρακύψας εἰς νόμον τέλειον...
οὗτος μακάριος. See Winer, p. 199. As subject, attracted to the

gender of the predicative noun, i. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ἐστίν,
ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς.
