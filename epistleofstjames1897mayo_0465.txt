it becomes effect, and danger of deviating from right ends in actual
deviation from it3 a danger necessarily arising from the very nature
of propension, and which therefore could not have been prevented‚
though it might have been escaped or got innocently through. . . . It
is impossible to say how much even the first full overt act of irregu-
larity might disorder the inward constitution, unsettle the adjustments
and alter the proportions which formed it, and in which the upright-
ness of its make consisted 3 but repetition of irregularities would pro-
duce habits. And thus the constitution would be spoiled, and creatures
made upright become corrupt and depraved in their settled character,
proportionably to their repeated irregularities in occasional acts. But
on the contrary these creatures might have improved and raised them-
selves to an higher and more secure state of virtue by the contrary
behaviour 3 by steadily following the moral principle supposed to be
one part of their nature, and thus withstanding that unavoidable
danger of defection, which necessarily arose from propension, the other
part of it. For, by thus preserving their integrity for some time, their
danger would lessen3 since propensions by being inured to submit
would do it more easily and of course: and their security against this
lessening danger would increase 3 since the moral principle would gain
additional strength by exercise: both which things are implied in the
notion of virtuous habits. Thus then vicious indulgence is not only
criminal in itself, but also depraves the inward constitution and
character. And virtuous seli-government is not only right in itself
but also improves the inward constitution and character: and may
impr-ove it to such a degree that, though we should suppose it impos-
sible for particular affections to be absolutely coincident with the
moral principle, and consequently should allow that such creatures, as
have been above supposed, would for ever remain defectible, yet their
danger of actually deviating from right may be almost infinitely
lessened, and they fully fortified against what remains of it.'

Butler then proceeds to argue that ⁴ this world is peculiarly fit to be
a state of discipline to such as will set themselves to mend and improve.
For the various temptations with which we are surrounded,—our ex-
perience of the deceits of wickedness, having been in many instances
led wrong ourselves, the great viciousness of the world, the infinite
disorders consequent upon it, our being made acquainted with pain and
sorrow either from our own feeling of it or from the sight of it in
others‚-these things, though some of them may indeed produce wrong
effects upon our minds, yet when duly reflected upon, have, all of them,
a direct tendency to bring us to a settled moderation and reasonable-
ness of temper, the contrary both to thoughtless levity, and also to
that unrestrained sels-will and violent bent to follow present inclina-
tion, which may be observed in undisciplined minds. . . . Allurements to
what is wrong, difficulties in the discharge of our duty, our not being
able to act an uniform right part without some thought and care, and the
-opportunities which we have, or imagine we have, of avoiding what we
dislike or obtaining what we desire by unlawful means, when we
either cannot do it at all, or at least not so easily, by lawful ones,—
