tians (ii. 12) and from the Acts (xv. 1, 5, 24) that the Judaizing
opposition to St. Paul at Antioch was encouraged by persons
who professed to represent the views of the Church of Jerusalem
and of its President in particular. If there were any epistle
known to the Syrian Church bearing the name of «1311103, 11 may
be taken for granted that this would have been eagerly read by
Paul when he was about 10 1310311 113 behalf of the freedom of his
Gentile converts before the Church of Jerusalem. More particu-
larly would this be so, if any phrases in the epistle could be
turned against his own doctrine of justification by saith, by those
who maintained that «10117 and Gentile alike could only be justified
by the works of the law. It has been justly reinarked that the
words ‘whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all' (James ii. 10) might easily be twisted by
the Judaizers so as to represent St. «1311103 33 insisting on the
observance of the whole Mosaic code ; and that it is perhaps this
inisinterpretation which is referred to in the words ‘ we have heard 1
that certain which went out from us troubled you saying, Ye must
be circuincised and keep the law, to whom we gave no such com-
mandinent' (Acts xv. 240} On the other hand there is much less
likelihood of St. Paul's Epistles‚ addresscd to distant churches and
dealing so much with persona] questions, being brought under the·
notice of St. J ames. That there is a connexion between the
epistles of the two men, has been the general belief in the Church
from the time of Augustine downwards, but this connexion has
been usually explained on the supposition that James meant
either directly to controvert Paul's own teaching, or at any rate to
put forward considerations which might serve to restrain the ex-
travagances of his followers. It has been pointed out however by
the more careful students of our Epistle‚ such as Neander and
Bp. Lightfoot, that the argument therein contained on Faith and
VVorks has no bearing on St. Paul's doctrine, its purport being, in
the words of John Bunyan, to insist that ‘ at the Day of Doom, men
shall be judged according to their fruit. It will not be said then
