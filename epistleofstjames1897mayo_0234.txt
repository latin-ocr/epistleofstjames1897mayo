ccxiv INTRODUOTION

for examples from classical writers, Isaeus vi. 43 εἰς τοῦτο ἀναιδείας
ἥκουσιν ὥστε διεμαρτύρουν τάναντία οἷς αὐτοὶ ἔπραξαν, οἵτινες
ἀπέγραψαν αὐτοὺς κ.τ.λ., Xen. Aycs. i. 36 ἄξιον ἄγασθαι αὐτοῦ,
ὅστις ὑπ’ ον’δενὸς ἐκρατήθη, Ellendt, Lem. Soph. s.v. ii. 3. The
only unclassical use is the modified Hellenistic emphasis on αὐτοὶ
in ii. 7.= ‘is it not they who '‘.2 We do not find St. Luke's αὐτὸς
ὁ for ὁ αὐτός, nor ὅς nor ποῖος for τίς, as seems to be the case in
Matt. xxvi. 50, xxiv. 43, Acts xxiii. 34.

None of the examples mentioned under Nmnber ancl Gcmlcr are
contrary to classica] usages‚ while some are idiomatic, eg. ἄγε νῦν with
plural verb, a use of ἄγε which is not found elsewhere in the N.T.

Casca—The use of the Nom. in apposition to an oblique case
(iii. S τὴν γλῶσσαν...μεστὴ ιὀῦ) is certainly harsh, but admits of
some explanation, which distinguishes it from the solecisms quoted
in the note from St. Mark and the Apocalypse.

Perhaps the point in which our Epistle departs most from
classical usage is in regard to the Genitive of Quality, such as
ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς i. 25, κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν ii. 4, ὁ
κόσμος τῆς οἰδικίας iii. 6. Vorst explains this by the comparative
paucity of adjectives in the Hebrew language (chon pp. 244 folL),
comparing Acts ix. 15 σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς, Heb. i. 9 ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς
εὐθύτητος, Hosea xii. 7 where the Heb. ‘balance of deceit' is
expressed by ζυγὸς ἀδικίας of the LXX„ but in Prov. xx. 23 by
ζυγὸς δόλιος.

The only use of the Dative which seems to call for notice here
is the Hebraistic use of the cognate with intensive force in V. 17

προσευχῇ προσηύξατο. This is found in several books of the
N.T. but apparently not in St. Paul's writings.

Po‘cpositioozs.—The constructions ὁ ι’ὸς εἰς μαρτύριον ἔσται, and
ἐλογίσθη εἰς δικαιοσύνην are Hebraistic and not found in Classical
authors, though common in the N.T., see notes on ii, 23, v. 3.
The distinction between εἰς and ἐν is never lost in St. J ames, as it
is in some of the writers of the N.T.

ἐπί ; used with acc. where we might have expected either the
simple dat. or dat. with ἐπί, eg. ii. 7 after ἐπικαλεῖν (cf. 2 Chron.
vii. 14 ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου, Acts xix. 13 ὀνομάζειν
ἐπὶ τοὺς ἔχοντας τὰ πνεύματα τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Κυρίου, but Plato
Tim. 60 ᾧ γένει κέραμον ἐπωνομάκαμεν, Rep. vi. 493 ὀνομάζειν
