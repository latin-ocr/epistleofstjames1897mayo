ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxli

heading ‘loyalty to God.' The word ‘humility' is used through-
out in reference to our attitude towards God. Quarrels arise from
an unchastened desire for worldly good. We cannot have peace
either in onrselves or with our neighbours until we submit
ourselves unreservedly to God, who resists those that aim at
worldly success and make a god of self, but gives grace to those
that surrender up their wills to His. He who tempted Eve tempts
us also to set up our will against God's will; but, if we refuse to
listen‚ the tempter flies; while any attempt on our part to draw
near to God brings Him near to us. The meaning of ‘ exaltation‚'
ὑψώσει, 111 1110 10111 verse is explained by τῷ ὕψει in i. 9. It
refers to 110 outward prosperity, but to the moral dignity which
belongs to him who has made God his portion.

Br‘uckner refers, as I have done, to the common quotations
contained in the two Epistlcs. I pointed out that it was
characteristic of St. James to quote carelessly, of St. Peter
10 quote accurately3 that the former uses 3 biblical phrase
without reference to its original context, while the latter holds
fast to the original context. To 1110 11110 000111οᾶ 10 favour the
supposition that 81. Peter was the copyist. Bruckner takes the
reverse view. I leave it to each man's common-sense to say
which is right, after he has compared the contexts of tho
quotations in the two Epistles.

His next point- is that τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα 111 James ii. 7 has to be
explained from 1 Pet. iv. 14-16 εἰ ὀνειδίζεσθε ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ
μακάριοι...εἰ δὲ ὡς Χριστιανὸς (πάσχει), μὴ αἰσχυνέσθω, δοξαζέτω
δὲ τὸν Θεὸν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ. Τ1110 10 3 similar case to the
preceding. In my view it exhibits 81. Peter, as usual, filling up the
bare outline of 81. J 311100. That the phrase needs no explanation
is plain from the parallel passages quoted 111 my notes ιή loco and
on v. 14 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι.

Lastly he thinks that the πρὸ πάντων of ‚J ames v, 12 has been
transferred from its more appropriate context in 1 Pet. iv, S. In
1ny note on V. 12 I have pointed out that πρὸ πάντων 1111101 be
understood in reference to other manifestations of an iinpatient
spirit, and not as exalting the abstaining from oaths above all
other Christian duties. Probably it was a common phrase with
the writer. If it was suggested, as I believe, to 81. Peter by his
acquaintance with our Epistle‚ he would naturally employ it of a
matter of more general importance.
