188 COMMENT

such tests 01 131111 35 are not naturally grievous, in wealth, power,
beauty, popularity, prosperity of every kind2 Or, yet further, in the
external temptations 01 1116 world, the flesh and the devil'? Might
<Ioseph rejoice in the temptation which came to him in Potiphar's
house, as well as in that which came when his brothers sold him to the
Midianites‘! The conquest 01 pleasure-temptation is not less useful
as experience3 it is not less strengthening to the character than the
conquest over pain : to have gone through such temptation unscathed
may be the ground 01 deepest thankfulness afterwards, but the spiri-
tual joy in resisting temptation of which St. J ames speaks is not com-
patible with any lower feeling of pleasure. To have suddenly come
into possession of a great fortune is a cause of rejoicing to the natural
man : one who has a right sense 01 1116 responsibilities and the snares
of wealth may shrink from it as a burden, or enter upon it With much
anxiety and sels-suspici0n3 but we can hardly conceive of such an in-
version of the ordinary view as to allow of a man's rejoicing in wealth
as 3 trial. St. J ames just below speaks of the poor as rejoicing in his
(lignity, but the rich in his humiliation 35 3 Christian—both equally
difficult and the latter especially painful to the natural man. One-
simus and Philemon may both rejoice in the new relation of brother-
hood, which replaces that 01 slavery and lordship : 130 1116 0116 113 may
bear the aspect of a levelling up, to the other of 3 levelling down 3 but
in reality what both rejoice in is the falling into the background of
the old transitory distinction in comparison with their common fellow-
ship in the eternal glory.

The 0311 10 rejoice 15 01 course not exclusively made to those who
are tried. There is 3 natural joy which is not condemned, but which
needs 10 116 associated with the thought 01 God to guard it from
becoming 3 snare to us (011. V. 13). ‘ Rejoice in the Lord always ’ is a
universal precept 101· 311 011115113115, 111113 0116 that has to 116 insisted
upon especially in the case of those whose circumstances naturally
ternpt them to sorrow. It is a bracing appeal to them (like St. Paul’s
in Eph. vi. 10 1011.) 10 muster up all their courage, and to look their
difficulties in the face, seeing in them a Divine discipline, which they
are to accept 35 561113 by Him who knows what is best 101· them and will
not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able. On the other
hand there is a 13156 joy springing from a confidence in ourselves and
in our circumstances, which shows that we aim at the friendship 01 the
world, and which necessarily separates us from God (ch. iV. 4, 16). This
false joy must be exchanged for the sorrow of repentance before the
true joy can enter our hearts (iv. 9, 10).

In ver. 12 St. J ames seems still to have in his eye the rich man who
is tried, while he also guards against 3 possible misunderstanding 01
1116 encouragement given in ver. 2. Trial can only be 3 5111136013 01
rejoicing when it is patiently endured. He who gives way to the
temptation involved in trial is in no way benefited, but the reverse,
unless, 35 111 the case 01 St. Peter, his discovery of his own weakness
leads him to 3 deeper repentance.

A still more serious error is met in ver. 13. Man throws the blame
