RELATION ΤΟ OTHER BOOKs OF THE NT. ei

seen, seems to make ‘ the proud ’ equivalent to ‘the friends of the
world,' and the ‘humble' to be those who submit themselves to
God.

The last quotation is that from the Hebrew (not the LXX.) of
Prov. x. 12, ‘Hatred stirreth up strife, but lore comem all sins?
which we find in James v. 20 and 1 Pet. iv. 8; but here again the
former simply makes use of a familiar phrase without regard to the
bearing of the context, applying it to the conversion of the erring
ὁ ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ . . . κ αλ ύ ψ ε ι
πλ ἣ θ ο ς ἁ μ α ρ τ ι ὣ ν, while St. Peter keeps to the original
application, πρὸ πάντων τὴν εἰς ἑαυτοὺς ἀγάπην ἐκτενῆ ἔχοντες,
ὅτι ἀγάπη καλύπτει πλῆθο 9 ἁμαρτιῶν.

It is scarcely necessary to point out how these facts confirm the
general evidence as to the priority of our Epistle to that of St.
Peter. The language of a Christian writer, in the first century
even more than in the nineteenth, was inevitably coloured by his
study of the O.T. This fully accounts for the Scriptural quotations
and allusions in St.Ja1nes. It is again perfectly natural that a
contemporary of St. James‚ reviewing his Epistle in order to adapt
it for a special class of readers, should, it may be even uncon—
sciously, correct the references to the O.T., sometimes by supplying
points which had been overlooked, as in speaking of the trial of
saith, sometimes by applying them with more exactness, as in
regard to the simile of the fading fiower. But surely the converse
supposition is most improbable, that the later writer should
deliberately misquote and misapply passages which were correctly
given in his authority ἒ [Compare what is said in answer to
Bri'ickner on this point in ch. vii„ and Spitta pp. 183-202]
