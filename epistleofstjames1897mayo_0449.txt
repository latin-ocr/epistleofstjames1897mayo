16, ἐξομολογεῖσθε οὖν ἀλλήλοις τὰς &papa-[as] Instead of τὰς ἁμαρτίας,
read by WH. Ti. Treg. with 1116 best Mss„ Alford reads τὰ παραπτώ-
ματα, found in K L Pesh., Τ116ορ11571301, oecumenius, and Origen in
Proverb. (Mai ANOU. Bz'b. Vii. 51) ὃ Ἰάκωβος φησὶν, ἀλλήλοις ἐξαγγέλλετε
τὰ παραπτώματα ὑμῶν ὅπως ἰαθῆτε. Ii] may perhaps receive some slight
support, from the Didache 4. 14 ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐξομολογήσῃ τὰ παραπτώματα
σου καὶ οὐ προσελεύσῃ ἐπὶ προσευχήν σου ἐν συνειδήσει πονηρᾷ, ib. XiV. 1
κατὰ κυριακὴν...κλάσατε ἄρτον καὶ εὐχαριστήσατε προεξομολογησάμενοι τὸ.
παραπτώματα ὑμῶν ὅπως καθαρὰ ἡ θυσία ὑμῶν ᾗ· πᾶς δὲ ἔχων τὴν ἀμφιβολίαν
μετὰ τοῦ ἑταίρου αὐτοῦ μὴ συνελθέτω ὑμῖν ἕως οὗ διαλλαγῶσιν, ἵνα μὴ κοινωθῇ
ἡ θυσία ὑμῶν, Clem. Ep. ad -JaC. 15 ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰ παραπτώματα καὶ
τὰ ἐξ ἐπιθυμιῶν ἀτάκτων σωρευθέντα κακά, ἅτινα τῷ ὁμολογῆσαι ὥσπερ
ἀπεμέσαντες κουφίζεσθε τῆς νόσου, προσιέμενοι τὴν ἐκ τῆς ἐπιμελείας σωτήριον
ὑγίειαν. The latter reading seems 10 agree better with what, appears
10 be 1116 561156 of 1116 passage, if we understand 11 35 referring 10 our
Lord’s words reported in Matt. v. 23 foll. and vi. 14 : 1116 51113 01 1116
sick man will only be forgiven if he forgives others who have injured
him, and if he makes amends for any injuries he may himself have
committed. St. J ames expands the precept 0111 01 115 narrow applica-
11011 ⁶ 161 1116 51011 man confess his trespasses 10 111056 against, whom he
has trespassed and 161 them in turn confess any trespasses which they
may have committed against 111111, and join in prayer for him, in order
that he may be healed of his bodily ailment,' into 1116 general rule ‘ con—
fess your trespasses to each other, and 131357101- each other at all times,
11131 576 may be healed 01 all your diseases whether of body or soul.’
The use of the word οὖν implies the close connexion of the present
with 1116 preceding clause (‘ since prayer has such power, pray for each
other3 and, 11131 you may be able 10 (10 this better, confess your faults
10 63011 other ⁷).

If we read ἁμαρτίας 11 15 more natural 10 understand 1116 confession
to refer nob 10 trespass towards man, but to sins towards God
(though ἁμαρτάνω 13 3150 used of the former, as in Matt. xviii. 15, 21).
Such confession (ἐξομολόγησις)1 was made to John 1116 Baptista (Matt. iii.
6) and by 1116 penitents at, Ephesus 10 Paul (Acts xix, 18), bun for long
after 1116 apostolic age 11 5661115 to have been unusual, except, in the
case of converts or penitents who were under ecclesiastical censure.
For others 1116 words of Augustine held good (Cowf. X. 3) quid milei
est cum hominibus ut audiant eowffessioues meas, quasi ipsi &maturi sinz
omnes lccnyuores meos, and the even stronger words of Chrysostom (Hom.
απτ. in Gen. p. 175 (quoted in Bingham xviii. 3, and in Drica. of Cle. Ant.
under Exomoloyesis. We need not, however suppose any reference here

¹ st. John uses the active of the simple verb in place of 1116 more common ἐξομ-

ολογοῦμαι, see 1 John i. 9 ἐὰν ὁμολογῶμεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας. 111 the LXX. ἐξαγορεύω is
used in the same 561136.
