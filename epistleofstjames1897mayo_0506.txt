226 COMMENT

low, that it is necessary to appeal to the All-seeing Witness in order to
make the affirmant realize what is his duty in respect of the
truth. And thus swearing becomes allowable, just as war is allowable
in the present imperfect state of things 3 yet the aim of the Christian
should be, as far as possible, to limit the use both of oaths and of war,
so as ultimately to get rid of them altogether. See an excellent
article, in the Cone. Rev. vol. 49, pp. 1-17, by the late Archbishop
Magee, on the substitution of a declaration for an oath in admitting
members of Parliament. Unhappily in this, as in some other matterS,
the professed advocates of religion have often taken a lower view than
its professed opponents. The earnestness of St. James muns pro—
hibition is probably to be ‘explained by the constant breach of the
third commandment caused by the J ewish habit of swearing.

HEALING or THE SICK BY ANOINTING wrm OJL AND ΒΥ ΡΒΑΥΕΒ.

There can be little doubt that St. J ames is here describing a miracu-
lous cure following the prayer of faith. Το encourage the elders to
obey his injunctions, he first insists on the power of prayer, when
inspired by the Divine Spirit, and then refers to an example of this
power in the person of Elijah, a man, as he reminds them, of like
weakness with ourselves. A difficulty arises here: if every sick
person could be miraculously healed, how is it that St. Paul did not
miraculously heal Timothy and others (l Tim. v„ 23, 2 Tim. iv. 20)¹2
Why was not his own thorn in the flesh removed? We hear occasion-
ally of miraculous cures, but they are plainly exceptional. May not the
explanation lie in the word ἐνεργουμένη (ver. 17)2 XVhen a miracle
was to be wrought the power of the Spirit made itself felt in the prayer
which preceded. Elijah himself could not work a miracle at will. He
too must wait, like Samson, till the spirit of the Lord came upon him.
One reason why the elders, rather than others, were to be called in,
may have been that they were better able to judge what was the will
of the Spirit. From v. 16, however, it would appear that the office of
prayer and anointing and receiving confessions was not confined to
them. It has been already pointed out (pp. cxxiii. foll„ clxxvi.) that the
assumption here made by St. James, that the anointing of the sick
would be attended by a miraculous cure, if performed in the spirit of
prayer, is a mark of the very early date of the Epistle.

Are we to consider that the scope of this injunction, which is
evidently temporary in form, is limited to the age in which it was
written, or is it in any way applicable to our own time‘l The
prayers of the congregation are still requested for the sick in the
public services of the Ohurch of England3 and to offer such prayers
is a natural, we might say, an inevitable outcome of Christian
friendship. There are some who disbelieve in anything beyond a
subjective answer to prayer. Yet even they must allow that a
subjective action on the imagination may produce an objective
change in the bodily condition, as has been attested in many cases
of faith-healing, both among Protestants and Roman Catholics. But
