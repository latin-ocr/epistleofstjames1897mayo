INTRODUOTION

OHAPTER I
THE AUTHOR

Internal Evidence. The author speaks with authority and in the tone of the
O.T. rather than of the N.T. This agrees with what we read of James,
the President of the Ohurch at Jerusalem. Remarkable agreements
between this Epistle and the speeches and letter of St. J ames *contained
in the Acts. This J ames was known as the Lord's brother, p. v. Three
different explanations of the phrase. Passages of Scripture bearing on
the subiect. Natural conclusion from the lang-uage of Scripture confirmed
by Hegesippus and Tertullian. No sign of primitive tradition in favour
of the Perpetual Virginity. Hieronymian theory examined, p. xii.
Epiphanian theory, p. xxii. Helvidian theory, p. xxvi. Examination ot'
the objection, that the last is opposed to tradition, p. xxviii.; and to
Christian sentiment, p. xxxiii. Further particulars as to St. J ames
derived from uninspired writings, p. xxxvii„ the Gospel according to the
HebreWS, Hegesippus, J osephus, Clementine Homilies. General conclusion
as to the life and character of St. James, p. xli. Hellenism in Syria.
Resemblances between this Epistle and the teaching of our Lord, especially
as recorded in the Sermon on the Mount, p. xliii. Unbelief and conver-
sion of JameS, p. xlv.

CHAPTER II
EXTERNAL EVIDENCE Fon THE AUTHENTICITY or THE EPISTLE

Direct evidence : Eusebius in his account of the Canonical books classes it
amongst the Antileqomena, but elsewhere cites it as genuine, p. xlviii. It
is omitted in the Muratorian fragment and in the Canon Mommsenianus ;
but included in the Peshitto and in the Catalogues of Origen, Cyril of
Jerusalem, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, Amphilochius of Iconium,
Epiphanius, J erome and Augustine, and was finally accepted by the third
Council of Carthage, p. xlix. Indirect evidence : was known to Clement
of Rome, to the author of the Didache, of the Epistle of Barnabas, and
of the Testaments of the Patriarchs, to Ignatius and to Polycarp, p. li.
Hermas is full of allusions to it, p. lviii. It is referred to by Justin
Martyr, Athenagoras, Irenaeus, Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria, and
by the writers of the Ep. ad Diognetum, and the Acta J ohannis, p. lxii.
Origen first cites it by name as Scripture and as the work of St. J ames,
p. lxiv. Allusions are also ‘found to it in Tertullian, Dionysius of
Alexandria, Gregory Thaumaturgus, the Clementine Homilies. Consti-
tutiones Apostolicae, Lactantius, Athanasius. Chrysostom and Didymus.
Byxthe end of the fourth century it is all but universally accepted, p. lxv.
