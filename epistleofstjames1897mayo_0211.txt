ON THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES cxci

cation of a righteous man availeth much in its working’
might perhaps be better translated ‘a righteous man's suppli-
cation availeth much when actuated by the spirit? iii. 18
καρπὸς δὲ δικαιοσύνης ἐν εἰρήνῃ σπείρεται, here it is to be
noted that καρπ. δικ. is a phrase found in Phil. i. 11, Heb. xii.
11, as well as in Amos vi. 12, Prov. xi. 30, and is therefore liable to
the abbreviation which naturally attaches to all proverbial expres-
sions. Possibly also the writer may have felt that the proleptic
use of καρπός would have acquired additional harshness if the
article were prefixed. It would have been natural to say τὸ
σπέρμα σπείρεται, but καρπός is not that which is sown, but
that which it is hoped will spring up. Peaceful sowing results in
righteousness as its fruit.

I proceed to the case of anarthrous epithets where the English has
the definite article. Such are v. 3 ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ‘in the
last days,' which occurs also in 2 Tim. iii. 1 : it may be compared
With 1 John ii. 18 ἐσχάτη ᾥρα ἐστίν, 1 Pet. i. 5 ἐν καιρῷ ἐσχάτῳ,
Sir. i. 11 εὖ ἕσται ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων, and even ii. 3 ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων σου.
011 the other hand we find ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις Acts ii. 17,
and τῇ ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ seven times in St. John’s Gospel. In James
v. 7 the R.V. ‘ until it receive the early and the latter rain ⁷ stands
for the Greek ἕως λάβῃ πρόϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον. In this last case
both article and substantive are dropped by colloquial abbreviation,
as we have ‘ Paul’s' in old writers for ‘ St. Paul's church.⁷

111 English we join the article with the superlative, even When
it forms part of the predicate, whereas the Greeks always omitted
it in such cases (eff. πάντων φιλομαθέστατος Κῦρος ἣν), and also
where the superlative denotes a high degree of any quality, as
James iii. 4 ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου πηδαλίου. Similarly the classical
writers omit the article with the ordinal numeral, as Thuc. v, 81
τέταρτον καὶ δέκατον ἔτος τῷ πολέμῳ ἐτελεύτα, and SO, in Matt.
xx. 3 and elsewhere, we find expressions like περὶ τρίτην ὥραν.
The omission is probably to be accounted for by the wish to
shorten familiar expressions where there is no danger of misunder-
standing being caused by it, just as we might say ‘7th Victoria,'
or ‘ Acts seven two.'

I come now to the phrases which I had reserved before: 1. 18
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λότγῳ ἀληθείας, with which may be compared
2 Cor. vi. 7 ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας, ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ, and Col. i. 5 ἐν τῷ
λόνγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου. The meaning in the two
