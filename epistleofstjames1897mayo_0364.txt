&4 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

tinctione among Christians see 1 Cor. xi. 22. St. Peter in his lst epistle
ii. 17 lays down the rule πάντας τιμήσατε.

οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν {apa-Bw] In the supposed case the sole
ground of preference between the two strangers was that the one
seemed rich, the other poor 3 but you have certainly no reason for
favouring the rich as a class. The verb only occurs elsewhere in Acts
X, 38 καταδυναστευομένους ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου, in N.T. but we find the
similar forms κατακυριεύειν and κατεξουσιάζειν Matt. XX. 25. It is not-
unoommon in LXX. with acc„ Cf. Micah ii. 2 οἴκους κατεδυνάστευον,
Amos viii. 4, Wisd. ii. 10 καταδυναστεύσωμεν πένητα δίκαιον κ.τ.λ., ib. XV.
14. It is used with a gen. in Diod. 13. 73, and in Aristeas (cited by
Spitta) XI. 4 μηδὲ τῇ περὶ ἑαυτοὺς ἰσχύι πεποιθότας ἑτέρων καταδυναστεύειν,
also in Herm. Mand. xii. 5 καταδ. τῶν δούλων τ. Θεοῦ. For warnings
against wealth cf. below v. 1 foll„ ] Τ1111. vi. 9, 10, Matt. xiii. 22, xix,
23 foll„ Sir. xiii. 3, 18.

αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια;] ‘ With their own hands drag you to
the tribunale! The pronoun αὐτὸς is used in the nominative, not only
with the meaning ‘ self ⁷ when attached to a subject, as in Classical
Greek, but also when itself standing for the subject, with a less amount
of emphasis, which we might render ‘he for his part ’ or ⁶ it was he
who‚' as in the next clause 3 it is disputed whether it does not in some
cases lose its emphatic force altogether, as in Luke xix, 2 καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ
ὀνόματι καλούμενος Ζακχαῖος, καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἀρχιτελώνης καὶ αὐτὸς πλούσιος,
where it seems pleonastic‚ so xxiv, 31 αὐτῶν δὲ διηνοίχθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ
καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, See Winer, p.
18ss foll. 5 A. Buttmann, p. 93 foll. I have not noticed the fem. and
nent. used in this laxer signification. St. Paul condemns Christians for
going to law with one another (1 Cor. vi. where see Wetst.) : here St.
J ames is speaking of the perseeution of Christians by Jews, especially by
the rich Saddueees, cf. Acts iv, 1, xiii. 50. Paul and Silas were dragged
before the judgment—seat (called κριτήριον 1 Cor. vi. 2, 4, Exod. xxi.
(5, Dan. vii. 9, Polyb. ix, 333 the classical word is δικαστήριον) at
Philippi, ἐπιλαβόμενοι εἵλκυσαν εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας (Acts XVi.
19) 3 and of Saul before his conversion we read σύρων ἄνδρας καὶ γυναῖ-
κας παρεδίδου εἷς φυλακήν. Our Lord foretold that his disciples would
be cited before the law eourts both of Jews and Gentiles (Matt. x. 7,
18), be expelled from the synagogues and put to death (John xvi. 2).

7, οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασφημοῦσιν τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα] ‘ IS it, not they who
blaspheme the noble nameZ' Βλάσφημος and its cognates are used
generally of slander and evil-speaking, as in 2 Pet. ii. 11, Tit. iii. 2,
Col. iii. 8 : in the N.T. they have also the special meaning of impiet)-
towards God and Christ (= λέγει ἀνάθεμα 'Ino-0510: so st. Paul (Acts
xxvi. 11) κατὰ πάσας τὰς συναγωγὰς πολλάκις τιμωρῶν αὐτοὺς ἠνάγκαζον
βλασφημεῖν, and 1 Tim. i. 13 τὸ πρότερον ὅντα με βλάσφημον καὶ διώκ-
την καὶ ὑβριστήν. Cf. Just-jn. M. Trypho ἓ 117 (Χριστοῦ) ὄνομα βεβη-
λωθῆναι κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν καὶ βλασφημεῖσθαι οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς τοῦ λαοῦ ὑμῶν
καὶ διδάσκαλοι εἰργάσαντο, ib. ᾗ 16 with Otto's note. We first read of
the sin of blasphemy and its punishment in Lev. xxiv. 10-16.
