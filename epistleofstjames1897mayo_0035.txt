be commonly and indeed exclusively styled his ‘brothers' by
indifferent persons; still less, that one cousin in particular
should be singled out and described in this loose way ‘James‚
the Lord's brother.’ ’² If we remark too the care with which
Hegesippus (quoted above, pp. viii. ix.) employs the term ἀδελφός
of James and Jude, the brothers of the Lord, while he keeps
the term ἀνεψιός for Symeon, the cousin of the Lord and second
bishop of Jerusalem, we shall feel that there is a strong proba-
bility against the use of ἀδελφοί in the N.T. to denote any-
thing but brothers, 212. in the case before us either half-brothers
or foster-brothers, according to the evidence to be considered
later on.

(2) Jerome's main argument is that James the Lord's brother Janies‚the
was one of the Twelve, and therefore identical with J ames the son *iii‘sstissiwif
of Alphaeus. He grounds this assertion on a single passage in St.. Waiffiiie‘me
Paul, whichIshallpresently examine. Bishop Lightfoot and others ΗΘΜ·
have shown that it is not a necessary consequence of St. Paul's
language, and that it is opposed to the distinction everywhere made
in the N .T. between the Brethren of the Lord and the Twelve.

Thus in Acts i. 14, after the list of the Eleven including James the
son of Alphaeus, we read ‘ these all continued instant in prayer '
σὺν «γυναιξὶν καὶ Μαριὰμ τῇ μητρὶ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς
αὐτοῦ. It will hardly be said that they are included in the
Twelve, as Mary among the women, and specially mentioned
afterwards, as she is, only on account of their superior importance.
If so, they would have been mentioned immediately after the
Apostles3 on the contrary they are placed after Mary, being
joined with her, as in several other passages, because they, with
her, constitute the family to which Jesus belonged. Again in
John ii. 12 we read that ,J esus went down to Capernaum αὐτὸς
καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκεῖ
ἔμειναν οὐ πολλὰς ἡμέρας; and in Matt. xii. 47 foll. ‘ One said to
him ' ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἔξω ἑστήκασιν ζητοῦυτές
σοι λαλῆσαι . . . . ‘and stretching forth his hand to his disciples
he saith' ἰδοὺ ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί ,aov- ὅστις ’γὰρ ἂν
ποιήσῃ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Πατρός μου, τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς, αὐτός μου
ἀδελφὸς καὶ ἀδελφὴ καὶ μήτηρ ἐστίν. In the last passage there
is the same strong antithesis between natural earthly ties and his
