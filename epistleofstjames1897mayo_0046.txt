solicitous about an only son, and that son the promised Messiah‚ as
to begin their homeward journey after the feast of the Passover at
Jerusalem, and to travel for a whole day without taking the pains
to ascertain whether he was in their company or not? If they
had several younger children to attend to, we can understand that
their first thoughts would have been given to the latter3 otherwise
is it conceivable that Mary, however complete her confidence in
her eldest Son, should first have lost him from her side, and then
have allowed so long a time to elapse without an effert to find him?

ἃ The usual answer to this is that the disbelief of the Lord's
brothers would naturally separate them from his mother. But as
this disbelief was even then on the point of being changed into
undoubting faith3 and as the separation, if it ever existed, of
which there is no evidence, was at any rate to be changed in a day .
or two into the closest union with all true sollowers of the Lord;
and as the preparation for this change must have been long per-
ceptible to the eye of J esus 3 it seems necessary to find another way ·
of meeting the obj ection,if it is to be met at all. I think however -
that Bp. Lightfoot goes a little too far When he speaks just below
of this hypothesis requiring us to believe that the mother, though
‘living in the same city' with her sons ‘ and joining with them in a·
common worship (Acts i. 14), is consigned to the care of a stranger‚
of whose house she becomes henceforth the inmatc.' We have·
seen that there is reason for believing Salome to have been

the sister of Mary, and John therefore her nephew3 but however
