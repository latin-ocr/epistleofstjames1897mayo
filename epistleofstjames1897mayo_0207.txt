ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES clxxxvi

ὁ νομοθέτης ὁ δυνάμενος iV. 12, ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς
ἐπερχομέναις v. 1, ὁ μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν τῶν ἀμησάντων τὰς
χώρας, ὁ ἀφυστερημένος V. 4·; of (3) ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινός (so B) i. 9,
νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας i. 25, ἀτμίς ἐστε ἡ πρὸς ὀλίγον
φαινομένη iv. 14, where the article makes the tendency to appear
and disappear a quality of the vapour, and not a mere accidental
circumstance3 so in Heb. vi. 7 γῆ γὰρ ἡ πιοῦσα, ix. 2 σκηνὴ
κατεσκευάσθη ἡ πρώτη; of (4.) we have τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ
σώματος ii. 16, τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως iii. 6, ἡ φιλία τοῦ
κόσμου iv. 4, ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος iii. 4. The loose construc-
tion (4) is more usual than the compact (1) in St. James and
the N.T. generally, especially where a pronoun is concerned, as
τὸ ἄνθος αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ (very rarely the compact, as
in i. 18 τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων,1 Phil. ii. 30 τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα);
sometimes the gen. precedes, as in iii. 3 τῶν ἵππων τοὺς χαλινούς.Υ
v. 12 ἤτω ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναί, 1 Tim. iv. 14 ἵνα σου ἡ προκοπὴ
φανερὰ ᾗ The loose construction also prevails in long or complex
phrases, cf. iv. 1 τῶν ἡδονῶν τῶν στρατευομένων ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν,
where the more idiomatic form would have been τῶν ἐν τοῖς
μέλεσιν στρατευομένων ἡδονῶν, and i. 5 παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ
πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς, where we might have expected either π. τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς διδόντος, or π. τοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς διδόντος Θεοῦ;
so i. 3 τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως might have been more com-
pactly expressed τὸ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν δοκίμιον. Classical parallels
will be found in the note on i. ὅ. We find the compact construction
however in iii. 9 τοὺς καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ γεγονότας and frequently
in both Epistles of Peter, as in the First i. 14 ταῖς πρότερον ἐν τῇ
ἀγνοίᾳ ὑμῶν ἐπιθυμίαις, ii. 9 τοῦ ἐκ σκότους ὑμᾶς καλέσαντος,
ii. 15 τὴν τῶν ἀφρόνων ἀνθρώπων ἀγνωσίαν, iii. 2 τὴν ἐν φόβῳ
ἁγίαν ἀναστροφὴν ὑμῶν, V. 1 ὁ καὶ τῆς μελλούσης ἀποκαλύπ-
τεσθαι δόξης κοινωνός; in the Second i. 4 τῆς ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἐν τῇ
ἐπιθυμία φθορᾶς, ii. 'T τῆς τῶν ἀθέσμων ἐν ἀσελγείᾳ ἀναστροφῆς,
ii. 10 τοὺς ὀπίσω σαρκὸς ἐν ἐπιθυμία μιασμοῦ πορευομένους.

If we wish to distinguish the shades of meaning attaching to
these different modes of qualifying the noun, (1) denotes the
final stage of thought by which the subject is combined with its
qualification so as to form one new complex subject 3 (2) gives the
