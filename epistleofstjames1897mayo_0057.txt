cluding in these the Clementine Hoinilies and Recognitions. We οι· the liseos

have to be on our guard against the Ebionite tendencies of some gasswrwl

froin unin-

of these writers, and their delight in puerile marvels and ascetic sirm-‘1
practices, but we may perhaps accept the general outline as correct, wrm&
since St.. James occupied a prominent position, and the facts

were for the most part patent to all the world, in marked con-

trast with the circumstances of the infancy and childhood of

our Lord.

The Gospel according to the Hebrews, which Bp. Lightfoot Theamwar-

auce of the

speaks of as ‘one of the earliest and most respectable of the qffirsdatfssssr

apocrypha] narratives ' (Gal. p. 27 4), is quoted by ,Jerome (De Vir. Jthe resur-

rectiori as

Illustr. 2) to the following effect: The gospel known as that ntffirgtgsdpffl

according to the Hebrews, which I have translated into Greek and 3⁰}²0⁰iiii>ng

Latin, and which is often referred to by Origen‚ tells us that the Hebron-s.
Lord after his resurrection appeared to James, who had sworn that

he would not eat bread fron] the hour in which he had drunk the

cup of the Lord till he saw him risen from the dead. J esus there-

fore ‘ took bread and blessed and brake it and gave it to J ames the

Just, and said to him, My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of

Man has risen from the dead? 1

¹ The Latin is Dominus motem cum dedisset sindonem sorio sacerdotis (apparently
implying that Malchus was present at the resurrection and received from the Lord's
hands the linen eloth in which his body had been Wrapt), ivit act ιῙίιοοῖηινη et ap-

nus for calicem Domini, ‘ as the point of time which we should naturally expect is not
the institution of the eucharist, but the Lord's death,' to which He had Hiinself alluded
under the phrase of ‘drinking the cup’ (Matt. xx. 22, 23, xxvi. 39, 423 cf. Mart.
Polyc. 14, ἐν τῷ ποτηρίῳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ σου), and the Greek translation, which goes
under the name of Sophronius, has Κύριος. There is however no various reading in
Herding’s edition of the Dc Vir. Itlustr„ and Mr. Nicholson, in his edition of the
fragments of the Gospel according to the Hebrews (pp. 62 fou), gives instances of
the untrustworthiness of the Greek translator. If Domini is the true reading, ‘the
writer represented J ames as presentat the Last Supper, but it does not follow that he
regarded him as one of the Twelve. He may have assigned to him...a position apart
from, and in some respects superior to, the Twelve... It is characteristic of aJuda1c
writer that an appearance which seems in reality to have been vouchsafed to ι1311163
to win him over from his unbelief, should be represented as a reward for his devotion'
(Lightfoot, Z.c.). The story appears in three other forms, given in Nicholsm, nono
of which date the oath from the Last Supper. Thus Gregory of Tours, in the srirth
century, (Hist. Fraozc. i. 21) writes: Fertur Jacobus» Apostolus, cum Dominum jam
mortuum vidisset in cruce, detestatum esse atque jurasse numquam se comesturum
panem nisi Dominum cerneret resurgentem. Tertia die rediens Dominus....sac0b0 se
ostendens ait ‘szcrye Jacobe, comede, quia jam a mortuis resurrexi* ; his contemporary,
