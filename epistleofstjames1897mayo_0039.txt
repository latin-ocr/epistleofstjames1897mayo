(3) It has been shown that probability is strongly against a

cousin of the Lord being habitually known as c‘zssehpbeo Κυρί,ου ar

and that the evidence 13 overwhelming against the brothers of the

Lord being included in the Twelve. Scarcely less strong is the W

argument against the Hieronymian view drawn from what we
read of the relation of the brethren of the Lord to his mother.
Though, according to this view, their own mother Mary was living
at the time of the crucifixion, and though there is nothing to show
that their father was not also living, yet they are never found in
the company of their parents or parent, but always with the
Virgin. They move with her and her divine Son to Capernaum
and form one household there (John ii. 12); they take upon
themselves to control and check the actions of Jesus3 they go
with Mary ‘to take him‚’ when it is feared that his mind is
becoming unhinged. They are referred to by the neighbours as
members of his family in exactly the same terms as his mother
and his reputed father3 the neighbours, it is evident, have no

more doubt as to the one relationship than they have as to the {ine
other; they have known the parents, they have known the ει

children; there is in their eyes no mystery in the matter, nothing ra ema no

to suggest anything out of the common order of nature. It is
suggested indeed that the Virgin and her sister were both widows
at this time, and had agreed to form one household; but this is
mere hypothesis, and is scarcely consistent with the remarks of the
neighbours, who endeavour to satisfy themselves that Jesus was
not entitled to speak as he had done, by calling to mind those
nearest to him in blood. We read that Joseph was still alive at
the time of the visit to the Temple in His twelfth year; the
neighbours must surely have known whether these six or seven
brothers and sisters were really Joseph’s children or those of
Joseph's sister-in-law. But we need not dwell further on this
point, since the assumption on which the whole theory rests is
untenable‚ as I now proceed to show.

(4) That Mary of Clopas was the sister of Mary the mother of
the Lord, is not only most improbable in itself (for where do we
find two sisters with the same name 2), but 13 not the most natural
