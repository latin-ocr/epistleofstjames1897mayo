c INTRODUOTION

δοκιμάζεται ἐν καμίνῳ ἄργυρος καὶ χρυσός, οὕτως ἐκλεκταὶ καρ-
δίαι παρὰ Κυρίῳ, and accordingly we find St. Peter supplying
these words (δοκίμιον) πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου
διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου. Another quotation appears in J ames
i. 10, 11 (let the rich man boast in his humiliation) ὅτι ὼε &neoc
χόρτου παρελεύσεται· ἀνέτειλεν «γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος σὺν τῷ καύσωνι καὶ
ἐξήρανεν τὸν χόρτον καὶ τό &neoc αὐτοῦ ἐΞέΠεοεΝ καὶ ἡ
εὐπρέπεια τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο· οὕτως καὶ ὁ πλούσιος
ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὐτοῦ μαρανθήσεται. This is evidently taken
mainly from Isa. xl. 6, 7, where the perishing nature of man is
contrasted with the imperishableness of God's Word. St. James,
it will be seen, confines himself to the former branch of the com-
parison‚ limiting it indeed to the case of the rich man, and makes
no mention here of the Word. But in 1 Pet. i. 23 the new life
communicated by the living and abiding Word of God, which St.
,J ames treats of in another part of his Epistle, is the subject of the
discourse (ἀνανγεΎεννημένοι...διὰ λότγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ καὶ μένοντος);
this is then proved by the quotation, given almost literally from
Isaiah‚ as follows: διότι Πᾶοᾼ oapi ὡς χόρτοε κώ mie& Adia αὐτῆς
ὡς &neoc χόρτογ· ἐΞΗράΝθΗ ὁ χόρτος καὶ τό ἅΝθοε &Hei-recen· τό Ae
ῥῆΜΔ Κυρίου ΜέΝει eie τόΝ aalma, the only changes being the in-
sertion of the first ὡς, the substitution of αὐτῆς for ἇΝθρώΠογ and
of Κυρίου for τοῨ ΘεοῨ ᾹΜὼΝ. In the passage of St. James we
observe the intermingling of another quotation from the Book of
Jonah iv. 8 ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν ἥλιον καὶ
προσέταξεν ὁ Θεὸς πνεύματι καύσωνι.

In the difficult passage James iv. 4-ss (‘whosoever would be a
friend of the world becomes thereby an enemy of God. Or think
ye that the Scripture saith without meaning, J ealously yearneth the
Spirit Which he hath implanted in you? But he giveth more
grace: wherefore he saith ⁷) ὁ Θεὸς ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται τα-
πεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν, the concluding Greek words are exactly
the same as in 1 Pet. V. 5, being taken literally from the LXX. of
Prov. iii. 34, except that this latter has Κύριος for ὁΘεός. The
context however in which they occur differs much in the two
Epistles. St. Peter uses them to enforce the duty of humility in
our intercourse with our fellow-men, ‘ Ye younger be subject unto
the elder: yea all of you gird yourselves with humility for God
resistam the proud, but yivetli grace to me humma: which is probably
the original application in the Proverbs 3 but St. J ames, as we have
