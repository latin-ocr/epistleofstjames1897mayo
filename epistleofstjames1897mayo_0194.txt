clxxiv IN TRODUOTION

desecration of their Temple by the Romans (ii. 2, 20-24, viii. 12²
foll). But the impiety of the foes of Israel is not unavenged;
Pompeius, the great Roman conqueror, has died a shameful death
in Egypt (ii. 30—33). Chapter iv. is thoroughly J ewish in its ini-
precations. The future glories of Israel are celebrated in chapters
x. and xi. The coming of the Messiah as the king of Israel forms
the subject of xvii. 23 foll. and xviii. In chapter xvi. the Psalmist
prays that he may be strengthened to resist the seductions of the
‘ strange woman.’ In iii. 9 the just man makes atonement for his
sins by fasting (ἐξιλάσατο περὶ ἀτγυοιάς ἐν νηστείᾳ). The reader
will at once see how different the whole atmosphere is from that
of our Epistle.

It may be said, however, that we must seek our parallel not in
the narrow-minded Hebraism of Palestine, but in the enlightened
Hellenism of Philo. Let us take then any treatise of Philo's
which touches on the same subjects as our Epistle, say that on the
Decaloyuc or the Heir of the Divino Blessiny ; do we find ourselves
brought at all nearer to the mind of our author? The great object
of Philo 15 to mediate between the J ew and the Gentile, to inter-
pret Gentile philosophy to the 0116, and Jewish religion to the
other. And his chief instrument in this work 15 0116 which had
been already applied by the Stoics to the mythology of Greece, the
principle of allegorization. He endeavours to commend the
Jewish sacred books to the educated Gentile world by explaining
them as an allegory in which their own moral and physical ideas
are inculcated. To do this he 15 obliged to neglect altogether the
literal meaning ; the lessons which spring naturally from the
incidentis described are often entirely inverted (0.9. the story of
Tamar) in order to extract by any torture some reference to some
fashionable thesis of the day, say the dogma of the interchange of
the four elements. The same frivolity is shown in the mystical
interpretation of numbers, such as 7 and 10. It is true there is
combined with this an earnest protest against polytheism‚ together
with a more practica] morality, and a lostier religious philosophy,
than is to be met with in Gentile writers; but the tone is far
removed from that of St. J ames. The former is very much at ease
in Zion, the latter has the severity and intensity of one of the old
Hebrew prophets; the former is a well—instructed scribe, the latter
speaks with authority3 the former is a practised writer of high aim
and great ability, gifted with imagination, feeling, eloquence,[tl1e
