preserve the honour of Mary in virginity to the end, in order that
her body, once chosen for so high a purpose, might not be degraded
to lower use, after the Holy Spirit had come upon her. . . . And I
think it reasonable that, as J esus was the first-fruit of purity aud
chastity among men, so Mary should be among women.' In.
accordance with this view we read in another passage,1 ‘J esus had
110 natural brothers, seeing that neither was any other child born
to the Virgin, 1101 was He Himself sprung from Joseph: wherefore
(those mentioned> were His brothers only in a conventional sense,
being 50115 of Joseph by a predeceased wife.'

The writings from which Origen borrowed his interpretation of
the word ‘b1·others‚' are two apocryphal books dating from about
the middle of the second century. We learn froin Eusebius, HE.
vi. 12, that Serapion, bishop of Antioch at the end of the second
century, forbade the use of the Gospel of Peter to a Cilician
Church, on the ground that it favoured the heretical views of the
Docetae. The latter portion of this Gospel (of course not contain-
ing the passage referred to by Origen) was discovered in a frag·
mentary condition in Egypt a few years ago, the Editio Princeps
being published in 1892. The othei· book to which Origen refers,
the P2·0te‹z·cmyelimn Jacobz', is still extant. It contains the story of
Anna and Joachim, the parents of Mary, of her miraculous birth
and betrothal to Joseph to be her guardian, he having been desig-
nated for this honour, against his will, out of all the widowers of
Israel, by the dove which issued froin his rod. The names of
Joseph's sons are variously given in the MSS. as Simon, Samuel,
James. Subsequent apocrypha] narratives relate the same story
variously modified. As to the historical credibility of such stories
,it may suffice to quote Bp. Lightfoot’s words (Gal. p. 275) : ‘ These
accounts, so far as they step beyond the incidents narrated in the
canonical Gospels are pure fabrication.’ Nor were they more
highly esteemed by early orthodox writers3 cf. C'onst. Apost. vi. 16,
where we read of the ‘poisonous apocryphal books in which the
wicked heretics reproach the creation, marriage, the providential
government of the world, the begetting of childrenj etc.; and
Jerome (CQomm in Matt xii. 49), where he taunts those who con-
