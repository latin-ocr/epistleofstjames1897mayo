DID ST. JAMES WRITE IN GREEK ΟΒ ARAMAIOE ccxxxiii

sent it to the ‘ upper barbarians,' whom he explains to be the Jews
beyond the Euphrates, &c.; he afterwards made a translation into
Greek, χρησάμενός τισι πρὸς τὴν εΕλληνίδα φωνὴν συνέρνγοις.1

The Bishop considers that these parallels make it probable
α priori that the Epistle was written in Aramaic. He supports
this conclusion by the assumption that St. James could not
have written such Greek as that in which the Epistle has come
down to us, containing, as it does, many words with Classical rather
than biblical associations, and implying a wide range of Classical
reading.2

‘This rich vocabulary is not unlike that which may have been
possessed by a professional interpreter, but is very remarkable if
we attribute it' to an unlearned Jew writing perhaps the earliest
book of the N.T.'

Last-ly the hypothesis of an Aramaio original is supported by a
comparison between our present Greek text and that which must
have been tho parent of the Corbey version (pp. iso-144). The
most remarkable of these divergences are the omission of τῆς
πίστεως in i. 33 the translation of τροπῆς ἀποσκίασμα by
‘ modicum obmnbmtionz's' (εροπὴ ἀποσκιασματος) in i. 17 ;
blasphemant in bono nomino for βλασφημοῦσι τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα
ii. 7, which Bp. W. compares with v. 1O and v. 15, where the
genitives τῆς κακοπαθίας· and τῆς πίστεως are also expressed by
prepositional phrases, clo malis passionibus in fide, such as might
be used in Hebrew or Syriac; calploratoo-es for τοὺς ἀγγέλους 11. 25
as in the Syriae and other versions ; ot linffncr, iynis seculi iniqnitatis
for καὶ ἡ «γλῶσσα πῦρ ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας iii. 6, where the
Peshitto has ‘the tongue is a fire3 the world of iniquity is as it
were a wood' 3 fornicatores for μοιχαλίδες· iv. 4· agrees with the
Peshitto ; ‘inconstans for ἀκαταστασία iii. 16, and frater for ἀδελφοί
iv. 11, are said to be easily explicable as renderings of the same
Hebrew word. {2207} erraveram& for τῶν ἀμησάντων V. 4, frequens
for ἐνεργουμένη V. 16, the omission of κενῶς, and the translation

1 c. Ap. i. 9, B. J. Prooem. 1.

2 This argument is founded on certain lists of words, which I found very helpful
in drawing up my own lists in Ch. IX. They contain however some inaccuracies:
e. g. among ‘classical non-Septuagint words' we find ἃλυκός, ἀμοίω, ἀποκυέω,
which occur either in the Ο.Τ. or Apocrypha in the passages indicated in my list 3
we find also δίψυχος, which, as far as I know, is never used in profane Greek of any
epoch‚ and ῥυπαρία, for which the earliest authority is post-classieal. To the ⁶ very
rare words' should be added ἐπιλησμονή, πολύσπλαγχνυς, ποοσωπολημπτεΐν, χαλινα-

γωγεΐν.
