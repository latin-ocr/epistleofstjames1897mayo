the laver was made out of the brazen mirror (Exod. xxxviii. 8), ἵνα καὶ

aut in speculum. The mirror‚ usually carried in the hand, was some-
times made of silver, but, more frequently of a mixture of eopper and
tin (D. of B. s. V.). The point, of comparison here is that the XVord
will show us whab needs to be cleansed and amended in our lives, as the
mirror in regard to our bodies. In shows us what·l we actually are in
eoum-ast, with what our deceitful heart paints us (ver. 26) : it shows 113
also what) is the true ideal of humanity which we are called upon to

realize in our lives.
24. κατενόησε καὶ ἀπελήλυθεν.] ‘J 11315 a glauce and he is off.' For the

gnomic aorisb often used in comparisons see ver. 11 ἀνέτειλεν,
A. Buttmann, p. 174, Goodwin, M. ancl T. ξ 30. The prolepbic perf.
(on which see Bubtmann‚ p. 172) expresses the suddenness and com-
pleteness of bhe achion, as in Xen. Cyon iv, 2. 26 ὁ γὰρ κρατῶν ἅμα πάντα
συνήρπακεν, Rom. XiV. 23 ὃ διακρινόμενος ἐὰν φαγῇ κατακέκριται, ib. Vii. 2.
011 the oombination of aoris‘n and perfect-1 see below ii. 10 ὅστις πταίσῃ
γέγονεν, Winer, p. 339. Both he and Buttmann (p. 171) ignore the
special force of the perfect here, and compare it with such barbarous
uses as Apoc. 17. 7 ἦλθε καὶ εἴληφε τὸ βιβλίον, where, as often in 15110
arguments 150 the speeches of Demosthenes, the perfect] cannot be
disfiinguished from the aoriSb‚ Cf. εἴληχε and πεποίηκεν for ἔλαχε and
ἐποίησεν in Pro Plcorm. hyp. p. 944. [γάρ, as in Ver. 11, justifies the
comparison: ib is to such a hasty inspection that careless hearing is
likened. Β. Weiss]

εὐθέως ἐπελάθετο] Dr. Taylor (J. qf Phil. vol. xviii. p. 317) has pointed
01113 that: t-he phrase is borrowed by Hermas in the remarkable passage
Vis. iii. 13 2.

ὁποῖος ἦν.] Τ110 (111-0οῢ form ποῖος 13 always used in N.T. for indirecta
interrogation except in this verse and in Gal, ii. 6, 1 Τ11033. 1. 9,
1 Corr. iii. 13. So always τίς, πόσος, πότε, πόθεν for ὅστις, ὁπόσος, ὁπότε,
ὁπόθεν. ‘'On-ov and ὅπως are frequent, but] 15110 former is never, the latter
only rarely‚ used in an interrogabive sense.

25. παρακύψας] ‘bending over the mirror in order to examine it
more minutely‚' ‘peering into it': so 1 Pet. i. 12 εἷς ἃ ἐπιθυμοῦσιν
ἄγγελοι παρακύψαι. It is used of John and of Mary looking into the
sepulchre (John xx. 5, 11), also in Sir. xiv. 23 (blessed is) ὁ παρακύπτων
διὰ τῶν θυρίδων σοφίας, <and so, of spying through a window or door,
Gen. xxvi. 8, 1 Ohron. xvi. 29, Prov. vii. 6, Cant. ii. 9, Sir. xxi. 23),
