burger‚ above all, of the great Neander, all of whom have given
their opinion in favour of the priority of James. If Neander's
great name is ‘passing into oblivion,’ I venture 10 think it
argurs ill for the future of theologica] study in Germany. But let
us see what further arguments are alleged against the early date
of the Epistle, ‘ A discussion on Faith and Works as the ground
of Justification could not have arisen before the question had been
brought into prominence by St. Paul's writings. The attempt to
assign the priority to St. James springs from the wish to leave no
room for opposition between the two ’ (J iilicher). ‘ The misuse of
the Pauline formula is presupposed in the Epistle.' ‘ The doctrine
of justification by saith and works combined belongs 10 1110 111110 of
Clement, Hermas, and Justin3 we cannot conceive that it was a
mere repetition of what had existed ninety years before; diese
Annahme, die uns an die seltsamste Dublette zu glauben nothigen
wiirde, unhaltbar ist ' (Harnack). To this we may add the more
general statement of Julicher quoted with approval by Harnack,
that when we compare this Epistle with what we know of the
prevailing views and interests of Apostolic Christianity, we find
ourselves in an altogether different world, 1110 world of the two
Roman Clements, of Hermas and of J ustin. The specific Christian
doctrines are conspicuous by their absence ; Christ is hardly
mentioned, and only as the coming Judge. Moreover, its late
date is shown by plain allusions to the Gospels‚ the Hebrews, the
Epistles of Paul and 1 Peter, and it is closely connected with
Hermas, though it cannot be absolutely decided which of the two
borrowed from the other.

I take first Jfflicher’s assertion that it was the wish 10 get rid
of the controversy between Paul and James which was father to
the thought that J ames was the first to open the debate. This, of
course, will not apply 10 111030 who hold, as I do, that we have
Paul's answer to J ames in the Epistle to the Romans. For others
the easiest way of getting rid of the controversy would have been
to accept the Tiibingen view, that J ames had nothing to do with
the Epistle, which was forged in his name by a late writer. (2) The
impossibility of a historical ‘ Dublette⁷ is a bold a priori assump-
tion, to which I think few Englishmen will give their assent. We
are not prepared to admit principles which would lead us to deny the
existence of Elizabethan Puritanism‚ of the High Churchistn of
