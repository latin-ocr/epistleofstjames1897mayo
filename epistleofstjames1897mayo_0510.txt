230 COMMEN T

‘The object of the passage is to encourage the exercise of those
mutual spiritual aids rendered by Christians to each other, which is
one of the great objects and privileges oi the institution of the
Church. The body was to sympathize with its several members. If
a man was in trouble, he was to pray ; if 111 joy, to sing hymns: in
neither case is the Apostle speaking of private prayer or private
singing3 but of those of the Christian congregationl: there every
individual Christian could find the best relief for his sorrows‚ and the
liveliest sympathy in his joy. St. Paul's command “Rejoice with
them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep,'' applies to this
same sympathy, which the prayers and hymns of the church services
were a constant means of expressing. But if a man were sick and
could not go to the congregation, still he was not to lose the benefit of
his Christian communion with them; he might then ask them to
come to him, and as the whole congregation could not thus be
summoned, the elders were to go as its representatives, and their
prayers were 10 take the place of the prayers of the whole church.
Care, however, is taken to show that the virtue of their prayers arises
not from their being priestS, but from their being Christians, and
standing in the place of the whole church. For these words im-
mediately follow: “confess therefore to one another your sins, and
pray for one another, that ye may be healed 2 there is much virtue in
a just man's prayer, when it is offered earnestly.'⁷ Now, this most
divine system of 6 living Church, in which all were to aid each other,
in which each man might open his heart to his neighbour and receive
the help of his prayers, and in which each man's earnest prayer,
offered in Christ's name, had so high a promise of blessing annexed to
it, has been 611110512 destroyed by that notion of 6 priesthood, which
claiming that men should confess their sins to 1116 clergy, not 65 to
their brethren‚ but as to God's vicegerents, and confining the promised
blessing 10 1116 prayers of the clergy as priests, not 65 Christians, nor
as the representives of the whole church, has changed the sympathy
of a Christian society 111130 1116 dominion of a priesthood and 1116
mingled carelessness and superstition of 6 laity.

ί813. John's language agrees with that of St. James: “ If any man
see his brother sinning a sin which is not unto death, he shall pray,
and Christ shall give him life, for those who are not sinning unto
death. There is 6 5111 111110 (1661113-113 15 not for that that I am
bidding him to pray.'' Here the very same blessing which st. J ames
speaks of as following the elders' prayers is said by St. John to follow
the prayer of any Christian, a clear proof that the elders were sent
for as representatives of the Church, and not as if their prayers

possessed a peculiar virtue, because they stood as priests between God
and the people.’
