I 21-23] NOTEs 67

of hearing, the other of doing.1 Of. also Taylor's Jemish* lvatlewers, p.
63 ‘ R. Chananiah used to say whosesoever works are in exc-ess of his
wisdom, his wisdom stands3 and whosesoever wisdom is in excess of
his works, his wisdom stands not' 3 ib. p. 75.

ἀκροαταί.] Regularly used of an attendant at a lecture, but distin-
guished from μαθητής by Isocr. ad Nic. 17 ποιητῶν ἀκροατὴς, σοφιστῶν
μαθητὴς γίγνου, ib. p. 405 Β. ; similarly ἀκουστής and auditor. As
Dr. Plummer observes, we naturally think of the reading of the
Scriptures in the synagogue, on which the Jews laid such sti-ess. The
word is used three times by Sty. James, only once besides in N.T.
(Rom. ii. 16).

παραλογιζόμενοι.] The only other passage in which it occurs in NT.
is Col. ii. 4 ἵνα μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς παραλογίζηται ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ, which Lightfoot
explains ‘ lead you away by false reasoning.' In LXX. it is more loosely
used, as 1 Sam. xxviii. 12 where the witch of Endor says to Saul ἵνα τί
παρελογίσω με ;

ἑαυτούς] Regularly used in N .T.‚ and often by classical authors, for
the plural reflexive of the lst and 2nd persons: cf. WViner, p. 187 foll.‚
Vorst. p. 68.

23. ὅτι.] Here = γὰρ, giving the reason for the injunction ‘ do not be
mere hearers,’ because on such the word has· no abiding influence. The
causal connection denoted by ὅτι, which is sometimes so close as to make
even a comnia unnecessary (eg. Matt. xx. 15 ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου πονηρός
ἐστιν ὅτι ἐγὼ ἀγαθός εἶμι ,·>, is sometimes so loose as to allow of its being
separated from what precedes by a full stop, as in Mark iii. 30 ἀμὴν λέγω
ὑμῖν...ἇμαρτήματος. ὅτι ἔλεγον πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον ἔχει, Luke xi. IS, ἰ’ὂ.
xiv, 11, Heb. viii. 10.

οὐ ποιητής.] Οὐ is used even in classical Greek after εἰ, when, as
here, it may be considered to coalesce with the particular word or
phrase to which it is joined, and not to affect the condition generally
(this takes place most easily with such words as θέλω or ἐάω), or when the
negative conception is immediately contrasted with its positive, as below
iii. 2 πολλὰ πταίομεν ἅπαντες. εἴ τις οὗ πταίει, 01· When it may be regarded
as parenthetical, being most exactly represented by the insertion of
such a phrase as ‘I do not say.' The same rule applies where the con-
dition is assumed to be the fact, εἷ being equivalent to ἐπεί or ὅτι. But
beside these cases, in which οὗ was admissible in classical Greek, the
later Greek employs εἰ οὐ instead of εἰ μή as more emphatic, the latter
being generally used without a verb (out of ninety-three examples cited
by Bruder only fourteen are followed by a verb) in the sense of ‘ but’
or ‘ except.’ Of εἰ οὐ Bruder cites thirty-one examples, omitting how-
ever this verse and iii. 2. On the other hand, μή is always used with

ἐάν (sixty-two instances in Bruder), never οὐ. See XViner, 599 foll„
A. Buttmann, 296 foll.

1 [On Exod. xxiv. 7, which ends (lit.) ‘we will do and we will hear‚’ it is written
(T. B. Shabbath 88a) that “ when Israel put ‘ we will do ¹ before ‘ we will hear,' there
came 60 myriads of ministering angels, and attached to each Israelite two crowns,
one corresponding to ‘ we will do’ and the other to ‘ we will hear,⁷ and when they
sinned there came down 120 myriads of destroying angels and tore them off.”
