Miltonic allegory, Satan is regarded as 1110 111131101- of sin, and he refers
in proof bo Test. Benj. 'A‘ πρῶτον συλλαμβάνει ἡ διάνοια διὰ τοῦ Βελίαρ,
to Test. Reub. 3, where the seven spirits of ‘che 5011505 are said to be
impregnated by the seven spii-ihs of Belial, and to 1110 rabbinical com-

The verb κύω or κυέω, 111 13110 sense of to be or to become
pregnant‚ is common in older Greek, eg. Il. ψ. 266 κυέουσαν,
Plato Tlaeaet. 151 B (in reference to the Socratic μαιευτική) ὑποπτεύων
σε ὠδίνειν τι κυοῦντα ἔνδον. Τ110 aorist of the shorter form is used
transitively (meaning ⁶ to impregnabe ') in Aesch. fr. 38 ὄμβρος ἔκυσε
γαῖαν, and in 13110 middle (meaning “oo conceive⁷) Hes. Tlceogs. 405.
Hence Hermann wished 130 limis, 13110 use of κύω to 13110 male, κυέω fio 1110

disbincbion is 11013 borne 01113 by MSS. or grammarians. Eustabhius even

κυήτορες, καὶ ἐκύει ἤγουν ἐγέννησε (p. 1548. 20, cited by Lol). Aj. 182).
