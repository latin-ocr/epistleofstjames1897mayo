176 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

(1 Sam. xii. 17). Compare also the story of the Legio Fulminatrix
given by Euseb. HE. v. 5.

ἐβλάστησεν.] The aor. is here transitive as in Gen. i. 11 βλαστησάτω
ἡ ’γῆ βοτάνην, Sir. XXiV. 17 ἐγὼ ὡς ἄμπελος ἐβλάστησα χάριν, more
usually intr„ as Matt. xiii. 26, Heb. ix. 4. In later Greek the present
also is sometimes found in a transitive sense, see Lobeck on Aj. l. 869.

19. ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν πλανηθῇ] Returns to the subject of ver. 16. For
ἐν ὑμῖν 500 above V. 13. There seems no reason to give, as Alf„ to
πλανηθῇ here the passive force which it bears in Apoc. xviii. 23 ἐν τῇ
φαρμακείᾳ σου ἐπλανήθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη. Τ110 passive aor. is used
with a middle force in classica] writers, as well as in the LXX. Deut.
xxii. 1, Ps. cxix. 176, Ezek. xxxiv. 4, and probably in Luke xxi. 8 and
2 Pet. ii. 15 καταλείποντες εὐθεῖαν ὁδὸν ἐπλανήθησαν. lt makes no
difference as to the admonition given, whether the wanderer goes
astray of his own will, or is led astray by others. See above 1. 16 and
πλάνη ὁδοῦ just below.

ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας.] See above i. 18, John viii. 32, 1 John i. 6, 111. 18,
19, 3 John 4 (I have no greater joy than to hear that my children) ἐν
ἀληθείᾳ περιπατοῦσιν, 117106. V. 6 ἐπλανήθημεν ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ ἀληθείας, Ps. CXiX.
30 ὁδὸν ἀληθείας ᾗρετισάμην.

ἐπιστρέψῃ rua] Found with the same force Mal. ii. 6 πολλοὺς ἐπέστρε-
ψεν ἀπὸ ἀδικίας, Luke i. 16, 17, Acts xxvi. 18, Psa. lxxiX. 3, Lam. v. 21,
Polyc. ad Phil. 6 οἶ πρεσβύτεροι εὔσπλαγχνοι..,ἐπιστρέφοντες τὰ ἀποπε-
πλανημένα, Apost. Const. 11. 6 τοὺς πεπλανημένους ἐπιστρέφετε, Plut. Illor.
21 (Menander) ἐπέστρεψε καὶ περιέσπασε πρὸς τὸ καλὸν ἡμᾶς, In Matt.
xiii. 15 and elsewhere it is used intinrnsitively, much as the passive in
1 Pet. 11. 25 ἦτε ’γὰρ ὡς πρόβατα πλανώμενοι, ἀλλ’ ἐπεστράφητε νῦν ἐπὶ τὸν
ποιμένα, καὶ ἐπίσκοπον τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν. The following τις shows that
this duty was not confined to the elders. As it belongs to the brethren
in common to pray for each other and to hear each othei-'s confessions,
so here they are in common exhorted to bring back wandel-ers to the
saith.

20, γινώσκετε.] So WH. with Cod Β. Τ110 majority of the best
MSS. have γινωσκέτω, keeping the regular construction. The use of
the plural after τις ἐν ὑμῖν may be paralleled by μὴ δῶτε after τις ἐξ ὑμῶν
above (ii. 16). On the other hand it is possible that an original γινωσ-
κέτω may have been altered to suit ἀδελφοί μου. Reading γινώσκετε, Ι
should be inclined to treat it as an indicative (as in Matt. xxiv. 32,
John XV. 18), calling attention to the well-known fact (like ἴστε in i.
19), probably also to a well—known saying, that conversion involves
salvation‚ rather than introducing· it as something of which they had
to be informed. Or, if we follow the other interpretation, and consider
that we have here an appeal to eulightened sels-interest, it may perhaps
be thought more worthy of St. James to mention this as a fact in
which all are interested, than to insist on it as a motive for the indi·
vidual who takes in hand to convert his brother.

ὁ ἐπιστρέψας &papi-comm] Why 15 this repeated'l Some say in order
to emphasize the facts but 0 more obvious reason would be that it
belongs to 0 quotation, and also that it is needed to avoid ambiguity,
