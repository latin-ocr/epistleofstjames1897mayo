I 27, II 1] ΝΟΤΕῠ4 75

ὁ Θεός, and the adv. ἀπροσωπολήμπτως 1 Pet. i. 17 also Of God (Of man
Clem. Rom. i. 1). Barn. 4. 12 ὁ κύριος ἀπροσωπολήμπτως κρινεῖ τὸν
κόσμον, PS. Hippol. p. 117 Lagarde κριτὴς ἀπροσωπόλημπτος. These,
so far as I know are the only instances of the use of these compounds.
The uncompounded λαμβάνειν πρόσωπον occurs in Luke xx. 21, Gal. ii.
6, and in LXX., LeV. XiX. 15 οὗ λήμψῃ πρόσωπον πτωχοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ θαυμάσῃς
πρόσωπον δυναστοῦ, Psa. lxxxiii. 2 ἕως πότε κρίνετε ἀδικίαν καὶ πρόσωπα
ἁμαρτωλῶν λαμβάνετε,· Malachi i. S, 9, ii. 9, Sirac. iv. 21 (Of false
shame) μὴ λάβῃς πρόσωπον κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς σου, ib. 27, xxxii. 12 f. κύριος
κριτής ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι παρ’ αὐτῶ δόξα προσώπου· οὐ λήψεται πρόσωπον ἐπὶ
πτωχοῦ...οῧ μὴ ὑπερίδῃ ἶκετείαν ὀρφανοῦ, καὶ χήραν ἐὰν ἐκχέῃ λαλίαν, 2
Κίῃὲζε iii. 14 πρόσωπον Ἰωσαφὰτ λαμβάνω, Didache 4, 3, Can. Eccl. 20.
In all these passages there is signified a bias of judgment owing to
the position, rank, circumstances, popularity‚ and externals generally
of the person judged. A just judge must not be influenced by
personal prejudices, hopes or fears, but by the single desire to do
justice. Other verbs used with πρόσωπον in much the same sense are
θαυμάζειν, J ude 16 θαυμάζοντες πρόσωπον ὠφελείας χάριν, 2 Chron. xiX.
7, Job xiii. 10, Prov. xviii. 5, Psalm. Sol. ii. 191 [used in good sense
Gen. xix. 21 ἐθαύμασα1 σου τὸ πρόσωπον, ‘I have accepted thee’] 3
ἐπιγινώσκειν, Deut. i. 17 οὐκ ἐπιγνώσῃ πρόσωπον ἐν κρίσει, ib. xvi. 193
ὑποστέλλεσθαι, Deut. i. 17 οὐ μὴ ὗποστείλῃ πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου, Wisdom
Vi. 83 αἰδεῖσθαι, tito„ Prov. xxiv. 23, ὃς οὐκ ἐπαισχυνθῇ πρόσωπον ἐντίμου
Job xxxiv. 19,- αἶρετίζειν, 1 Sam. xxv. 35 ᾑρέτισα τὸ πρόσωπόν σου
(good sense) 3 κρίνειν, Phocyl. 10 μὴ κρῖνε πρόσωπον. Equivalent
phrases are βλέπειν or ὃρᾷν εἷς πρόσωπον 111ειῖ1ς Xii. 14, 1 Sam. XVi. 7
ἄνθρωπος ὄψεται εἷς πρόσωπον, ὃ δὲ θεὸς ὄψεται εἷς καρδίαν, 2 Cor. X. 7 τὰ
κατά πρόσωπον βλέπετε, also κρίνειν κατ’ ὄψιν John vii. 24, κατὰ τὴν
δόξαν κρ. Isa. xi. 3, κατὰ τὴν σάρκα John viii. 15. In its strict sense the
Greek would mean to accept the outside sui-face for the inner reality,
the mask for the person,2 cf. Epict. Encla. 17 μέμνησο ὅτι ὑποκριτὴς εἶ
δράματος οἵου ἂν θέλῃ ὁ διδάσκαλος...σὸν τοῦτ’ ἔστιν τὸ δοθὲν ὑποκρίνασθαι
πρόσωπον καλῶς. Τ110 plural of the abstract refers to the many ways
in which partiality may show itself, cf. below iv. 16 ἐν ἀλαζονίαις, 2 Pet.
iii. 11 ἐν εὐσεβείαις, Col. iii. 22 ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλείαις, Jude 18 ἐπιθυμίαι
ἀσεβειῶν, Winer‚ p. 220, and for the similiar use in Latin my note on
Cic. Nl). ii. 98.

ἔχετε τὴν vio-rw] ‘Do not have your saith in personal respects,' ‘Do
not you, who call yourselves believers in Christ, disgrace your faith by
exhibitions of partiality.' WH. with marg. in RV. take ἔχετε as
indicative with a remark of interrogation, ‘ Do ye, in accepting person&

³ Aq. ᾖρα.

2 Mr. Jennings on Psa. lxxxii. 2 says the Hebrew ‘misci ριῖηῖφη priinarily in-
volves the act of raising the face of another with the view of comforting him.' lf this
is so, the meaning is entirely lost in the Greek translations and a much more striking
idea substituted in its place3 see Lightfoot, Gal. ii. 6 “ 111 the O. T. it is a neutral
expression involving no subsidiary idea of partiality, and is much oftener found in a
good than in a bad sense. When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however,

the 1)αὲ 'sense attaches to it owing to the secondary meaning of πρόσωπον as
‘a mas .
