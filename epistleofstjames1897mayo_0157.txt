ON THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxvii

contained in vv. 15, 16, and any reference to the royal law of
ver. 8, or to the pattern of pure religion depicted in i. 27. Is
this then an unusual sense of the word ἔργον 111 the New Testa-
menti? Does it usually include a reference to strict ceremonia]
observance ἲ Would it be naturally understood by Jews to include
this ’.ἰ Ι11 John viii. 39 the works of Abraham (tle. his hospitality
Sec.² Gen. xviii.) are contrasted with the murderous intentions of the
Jews 3 in Apoc. xx. 12 we read that the dead will be judged κατὰ
τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, meaning of course the same as κατὰ τὴν πρᾶξιν
αὐτοῦ 111 Matt. xvi. 27, which is explained of works of love in
Matt. xxv. :34-46. So over and over again we find in the Apo-
calypse οἶδα τὰ ἔργα σου, referring, as the context shows, to moral
conduct. St. Paul, writing after St. James, finds it necessary to
dist-inguish the ἔργα πίστεως and the ἔργα ἀγάπης, the natural
fruits of saith and love, from the e'prya νόμου, dead works done
from slavish obedience to an external law.

Again Von Soden, like his school in general, exaggerates the
negative side of the Epistle: the writer, he says, ignores the
Resurrection. What does he make of the phrase τῆς δόξης in ii.
12 This surely involves the belief in the Resurrection and
Ascension and even in the Divinity of Christ.

The final result of his investigation is that the Epistle was
written at Rome during the reign of Domitian to Christians
generally. Beyschlag well asks‚ If so, what possible inducement
was there for the forger, who was certainly no sectarian, like the
author of the Clementines‚ but an orthodox believer, to inscribe his
letter with the name of James, rather than of Peter? and if he
was determined to choose James, what possible motive could he
have for using the modest description ‘ servant' instead of ‘ brother’
of the Lord J esus Christ?

I will now take the most recent statement of the theory that the
Epistle was written in the second century. This is contained in
W. Briickner’s Dte chronoloyz'sclw Reilcmqfolyo der N catastamcntlc‘clcen
Bricfe, Haarlem, 1890.

According to his view the only epistles written during the first century
were those to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Philemon, Philippians,
Hebrews, and the lst to the Thessalonians. The first epistle of Peter was
written during the persecution under Trajan. As our epistle borrows from it
and shows no traces of being written under stress of persecution‚ the latter
cannot be assigned toan earlier period than the reign of Hadrian. The
priority of Peter to James is proved as follows. The topics common to both
