from the known facts of the case; and we need nothing more than
this to explain their sear that his mind might be overstrained, and
their attempt to dictate the measures he should adopt in going up
to the Feast‚ just as his mother had attempted to dictate to him at
the marriage of Cana.

(3) Dealing with the argument from tradition, we must bear in

historical belief at any given time depends, so far as the educated
minority is concerned, partly upon the critical interpretation of
supposed authentic documents by contemporary scholars, such as
Jerome in the fourth century, who regarded it as mere waste of
time to leave the Scriptures, the fountain of truth, and follow
opinionum rivulos, the fancies of later writers who had no other
ground for their guesses than the Scriptures themselves (J er. Adv.
Holv. 17). But even of the educated it is true to a certain extent,
as it is entirely true of the uneducated, that they take their
notions of history without inquiry either from the most popular
epitome or from what may be loosely called tradition. And tradi-

but that nucleus is 50 transformed by the action of the imagination,
and by the thoughts and feelings of the generations which have
passed since the actual occurrences of which it embalms the
memor-y, that we cannot trust it for details. Thus, while we may
fully allow the interest and importance which attach to the
thoughts and feelings of Christians in former ages, yet for our
present purpose it seems desirable to separate our consideration of

these from our consideration of tradition, as embodying an actual =

recollection of fact handed down orally from father to son, or
crystallized 111 literature at a certain stage of its progress. There
is also such a thing as manufactured tradition, like that of the
Ciceroni, or merely literary tradition, like that which has grown
up round the scenes of many of Scott's romances. In our investi-
gation of any so-called tradition it is of the utmost importance to
be on our guard against mistaking deliberate invention of this kind
for natural growth.

We have seen already that neither from Tertullian writing in i

the second century, nor from Basil writing in the fourth, do we
