AUTHENTICITY OF THE EPISTLE li

in the third Council of Carthage (397 A.D.), where our present
Canon of Scripture received its first undoubted synodical ratifica-
tion; though this was not binding on the Eastern Chul-ch till it
was sanctioned by the Trullan or Quinisext Council of 692 AD.
It will have been observed that, while the Churches of Rome and
Carthage long doubted the canonicity of the Epistle of St. J ames,
it was acknowledged from a very early period by the Churches of
Jerusalem and (probably) of Syria, and is included in the catalogues
of Sacred Books which have come down to us from the Churches of
Egypt and Asia Minor. The difference is easily explained from
the fact that the Epistle was probably written at Jerusalem and
addressed to the Jews of the Eastern Dispersion3 it did not
profess to be written by an Apostle or to be addressed to Gentile
churehes, and it seemed to contradict the teaching of the great

Apostle to the Gentiles.

Thus far I have confined myself to the evidence as to the
canonicity of our Epis-tle, which is to be found in catalogues more
or less forma13 but the casua] references which occur in early
writers are of no less importance and interest as bearing on the
question (1) of its date, and (2) of the authority attaching to it, as
proceeding from an inspired writer, if not an Apostle, yet one whose
words were no less weighty than those of an Apostle, Most of
the references occur without any mark of citation3 and in some
cases it may be thought that the resemblance to St. James is
merely accidenta13 but if I do not deceive myself‚ the general
result is to show that our Epistle was more widely known during
the first three centul-ies than has been commonly supposed. It is
a remarkable fact that our earliest witnesses belong to the Ohurch
which was one of the latest to recognize the Epistle as canonical,
viz, the Church of Rome. Zahn explains t'his from the prepon-
deratingly Jewish character of that Church during the first century

of its existence (Neue. Kan. I. p. 963). In proportion as the
