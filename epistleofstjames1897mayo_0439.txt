V 10-12] NOTES 159

the end. On the confusion between ει and ι in the MSS. see note on
iii. 3 ἴδε. Ewald understands τέλος as ‘ das Ziel welches Gott bei Job⁷s
Leiden hatte, n'amlich seine Liebe zu zeigen,' so Schegg and others,
comparing 1 Tim. i. 5 τὸ τέλος τῆς παραγγελίας ἐστὶν ἀγαπή, but
it is better understood (as in the Peshitto version emitum quem ei
fecit dominus) of the end appointed by the Lord, viz. Job's final
prosperity and the declaration of his integrity against Satan and the
friends, cf. Heb. xiii. 7 ὧν ἀναθεωροῦντες τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς
μιμεῖσθε τὴν πίστιν and Job xlii. 12 ὁ δὲ Κύριος εὐλόγησε τὰ ἔσχατα Ἰώβ
ἢ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν, Ρ3. 103. 8 οἰκτίρμων καὶ ἐλεήμων ὁ Κύριος, μακρόθυμος
καὶ πολυέλεος· οὐκ εἷς τέλος ὀργισθήσεται, 2 Cor. Xi. 15 ὧν τὸ τέλος
ἔσται κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, 1 Pet. iV. 17 τί τὸ τέλος τῶν ἆπειθούντωνς For
the subjective genitive Κυρίου cf. 1 Pet. iii. 14 τὸν φόβον αὐτῶν μὴ
φοβήθητε, 2 Cor. Xi. 26 κινδύνοις ποταμῶν, λῃστῶν, κ.τ.λ., Test. Gad. p.
685 ὅρον Κυρίου ἐκδέξασθε ‘ wait the limit appointed by the Lord‚⁷ so
δικαιοσύνη, εἰρήνη Θεοῦ. Augustine and Bede, with others of the older
commentators and Bassett, take Κυρίου of Christ, contrasting what the
readers had seen of his sufferings with what they had heard about
Job. But this, instead of giving one perfect illustration of the result
of suffering rightly borne, gives two imperfect and barely intelligible
illustrations. If τέλος is supposed to refer to the Resurrection and
Ascension, the main point of the comparison (suffering) is omitted: if
it refers to the Crucifixion‚ the encouragement is wanting. Moreover
if Κυρίου is to bear this force here, we should at least have expected
the article with it ; and the writer in the preceding verse bid them
look to the prophets as their examples, not to Christ.

ὅτι.] Epexegetic of τέλος. ‘ Ye have seen the final result of God’s
working, (showing) that God is merciful.‘ Alford, taking it in the sense
‘ because‚' gives a very forced explanation ‘look on to the end which
God gave J ob 3 and it is well worth your while to do so, for you will
find that he is very pitiful.'

πολύσπλαχνος.] ‘Sympathetic' Occurs elsewhere only in Hermasillcmd.

common in the Gospels, both derived from such phrases as σπλάγχνα ἐλέους
Luke 1. 78, σπλ. οἰκτιρμῶν Col. 111. 12, τὰ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἁγίων ἀναπαύεται
Philem. 7, κλείειν τὰ σπλάγχνα l John 111. 17, τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ περισσο-
τέρως εἶς ὑμᾶς ἐστιν 2 Cor. Vii. 15, αὐτόν, τοῦτ’ ἔστι τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα ‘my
very heart' Philem. 12, Prov. xii. 10, Isa. lxiii. 15, where Vulg. has
multitudo viscerum tuorum. The sing. is used in the same sense in
Test. Zab. 8 ὁ Θεὸς ἀποστέλλει τό σπλάγχνον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ὅπου
εὑρῇ σπλάγχνα ἐλέους ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ, Herm. Sim. iX. 24 σπλάγχνον ἔχοντες
ἐπὶ πάντα ἄνθρωπον. The word is sometimes used metaphorically by
classica] Writers, as by Eur. Med. 220 πρὶν ἀνδρὸς σπλάγχνον ἐκμαθεῖν,

but this is of disposition in a wider sense, not specially of compassion.
