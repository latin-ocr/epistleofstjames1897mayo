1 86 COMMENT

these things, i.e. the snares and temptations of vice, are what render
the present world peculiarly fit to be a state of discipline to those who
will preserve their integrity ; because they render being upon our
guard, resolution, and the denial of our passions, necessary in order to
that end. And the exercise of such particular recollection, intention
of mind, and self-government, in the practice of virtue, has from the
make of our nature a peculiar tendency to form habits of virtue, as
implying not only a real, but also a more continued, and a more intense
exercise of the virtuous principle, or a more constant and stronger
effort of virtue exerted into act. Thus suppose a person to know him· ·
self to be in particular danger for some time of doing anything wrong,
which yet he fully resolves not to do, continued recollection and
keeping upon his guard, in order to make good his resolution, is a con-
tinued exerting of that act of virtue in a high degree, which need have
been, and perhaps would have been, only instantaneous and weak, had
the temptation been so.'

Butler's distinction between the two factors in temptation, the inner
nature and the external circumstances, will help us to understand the
contrast apparent in the text between the trial (πειρασμός) 111 which
the Christian is to rejoice, and the temptation (πειράζεσθαι) which must
not be ascribed to God, since from Him only good proceeds. The
latter is the inner temptation, the former theouter trial, and not even
that in its full extent. External circumstances may try us either by
suggestions of pain, of which the great example is our Lord's agony in
the garden, or by suggestions of pleasure, exemplified in our Lord‘s
temptation in the wilderness, i.e. either by intimidating or by alluring.
It is the former, the trial by pain, which St. J ames has in his mind in
the 2nd verse, and by which those to whom he writes were assailed.
They were mainly poor and were suffering persecution and oppression
from the rich, as we gather from ii. 6, v. 7 foll. They were tempted
to murmur against God and to speak evil of men. St. J ames (below
v. 7—11) urges upon them the duty of patience, by showing how neces-
sary it is in common life, by appealing to the example of the prophets,
and pointing to the near approach of the judgment day, in which
murmuring and impatience would be punished and the blessedness of
patient suffer ing be revealed. Ηο10 110 bids them rejoice in these trying
circumstances because, if patiently endured, they would confirm theii
faith and fit 13110111 to 10001νο 13110 reward of eternal life promised to all

ἴ that love God. It is 131103 same motive which is appealed to in the
.¹' Sermon on the Mount (Matt. V. 4, 10-12) and in 1 Pet. i. 6 foll.
Another reason for rejoicing in affliction is given in Heb. xii. 6 : it is
l a mark of God's love towards those whom he chastises. In Acts v. 41
we read that the Apostles, when scourged, rejoiced that they were
¹ counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ. 3111361301
speaks of the partaking of Christ' 3 sufferings as a ground for rejoicing
J(1 Pet. iv. 13). St. Paul rejoiced 111 13110 thought that he was allowed
χ to supplement the affiictions of Christ f01 the sake of the Chur 011
(Col. i. 24).

The stages of Christian growth according to St. J ames are as follows:
