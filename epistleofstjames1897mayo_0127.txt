word, and frames his life in accordance with the law of

they are often rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom 3 while it is
the rich who maltreat the brethren and blaspheme the name of
Christ—ii. 5-7.

(3) If it is from obedience to the royal law of love that we show
courtesy to the rich, it is well: but if we do this only from respect
of persons, it is a breach of the law and a defiance of the lawgiver,
no less than murder or adultery.—ii. 8-11.
