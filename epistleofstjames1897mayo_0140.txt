cxx INTRODUCTION

In fact they exhibit an immature stage of Christianity, such as
must have continually been found among those who had become
believers on the day of Pentecost or through the preaching of
some passing evangelist, but were without any regularly organised
system of Christian teaching (J ames iii. 1 foll.)

The arguments of the Tubingen school, in opposition to the
Jewish nationality of those addressed, will be considered in the
chapter which follows, on the Date of the Epistle. Various in—
cidental expressions have been noticed by editors 1 as bearing on
this point. Abraham is called ‘ our father ⁷ in ii. 21, which in this
straightforward matter-of-fact Epistle must, by all rules of inter-
pretation, be taken, like the ‘Twelve Tribes of the Dispersion,' in
its literal sense, unless reason can be shown to the contrary. The
readers are supposed to be acquainted with the story of Job,
Elijah and the prophets (V. 11, 17). The phrase ‘ Lord of Sabaoth'
(v. 4), the reference to Jewish oaths and to the J ewish propensity
to curse and swear (iii. 9, V. 12), the term ‘ synagogue ' used for
their place of meeting (ii. 1), the high value attributed to the Law
and to the confession of the Unity of God——all mark the Jewish
nationality of the readers, and would be unmeaning or inappro-
priate if the Epistle were addressed to Gentiles. The same thing
appears from the reference to their avarice and their restless
pursuit of wealth (iv. 13—1G‚ v. 1—4).

As regards the place from which the Epistle was written, if we
are right in supposing that it was written by the Brother of the
Lord, there can be little doubt that it was dated from Jerusalem.
This supposition is confirmed by incidental allusions to the early
and latter rains (v. 7), to the effect on vegetation of the burning
wind (i. 11), to the existence of salt and bitter springs (iii¹² 11), to
the cultivation of figs and olives (iii. 12), and to the neighbourhood
of the sea (i. 6, iii. 4).
