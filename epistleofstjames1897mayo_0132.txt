CHAPTER VI

PERSONS To WHOM THE EPISTLE 1s ADDRassEu AND PLACE
FROM WHICH IT rs WRITTEN.

ST. J AMES addresses the Twelve Tribes in the Dispersion. For
the meaning of this phrase see the note on i. 1. I propose here
to sum up briefly the historical facts which it represents.

If we view the history of Israel from the outside, one of its
most remarkable characteristics is the long series of compulsory
transplantations undergone by this people from the time of Tiglath-
Pileser up to the present day. The Assyrian transplantation took
place in the latter half of the eighth century B.C. In it, we are told
that the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
together with the bulk of the Samaritans and some of the tribe of
Judah, were removed to upper Mesopotamia (1 Chron. v. 26, 2 Kings
xvii. 4—6, and xviii. 13). In the second transplantation the tribes of
J udah and Benjamin were removed to Babylon about the year 600
B.C. (Dan. i. 1, 2, 2 Kings xxiv, 14-16, XXV„ Jer. lii). The extent
and importance of the Eastern Dispersion is shown in the Books of
Esther and Tobit: Philo, writing shortly after the Christian era,
says that Babylonia and the most fertile satrapies beyond the
Euphrates were inhabited by Jews (ad Ocm'mn, M. 2, p. 587); and
we learn from J osephus that early in the first century after Christ,
Mesopotamia was for some fifteen years under the rule of the
Jewish leaders Asidaeus and Anilaeus,1 and that, after the death
of the latter, more than 50‚OOO ,Jews were massacred in the city
of Seleucia (Ant. xviii. 9, 4-9). A third transplantation was
that to Egypt, which commenced as a voluntary emigration in the
time of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings XXV. 26), but received a great
development in the foundation of Alexandria under Alexander and

1 Lewin, Fasti Sami, gives A.D. 18 to 33 as the period of their rule.
