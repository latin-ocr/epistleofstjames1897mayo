ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cliii

to which the Classical writings have been subjectcd has only served
to establish more firmly the genuineness of the disputed books and
passages, and so we cannot doubt it will be with the New Testa-
ment1 Experience proves the truth of the maxim—Ostisaianum
commenta delet dies, naturae judicia confirmat.

1 It is especially interesting to note how in both spheres we find the first thoughts
of youth corrected by the second thoughts of maturer age. Thus Zeller, who in
his Platonische Studdcn, 1839, had argued against the genuineness of Plato's Dc
Legibus, in his Historgs of Greek· Philosophy treats it as the undoubted work of Plato.
In like manner Kern, who in an article in the Tul). lecoloq. Zettsclcr. for 1835,
part 2, had ascribed our epistle to an unknown writer of the Qud century, argues
in his commentary, 1838, in favour of its genuineness; De Wette, who in the
earlier editions of his commentary had denied the authenticity of the epistle‚ in his
5th edition (1848) regards it as probably authentic; Lechler‚ who in the 1st and
2nd editions of his book on thc Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Times had made it a
post-Pauline production, treats it as pre-Pauline in his last edition of 1885 (Eng. tr.
1886) ; ancl from the preface to the 2an edition of Ritschl's Altlccccholisclw Kz'rche,
1857, it would seem that Ritschl's views had developed in a similar direction.
