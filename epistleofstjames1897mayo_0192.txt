enemies and to do good to them that hated them. In like manner
whereas J esus had foretold that the Son of Man should come in the
glory of His F ather to reward every man according to his works,
J ames evidently regards God as the final J udge, for the Judge and
the Lawgiver are one (iv. 12), and the cry of the injured husband-
men goes up to the Lord of Sabaoth, whose coming the brethren
are to await in patience, for He is near, even at the doors (v. 4, 7,
8, 9).1

I cannot help thinking that much of the difficulty which is
found in the Epistle, arises from our bringing to its study the idea
of Ohristianity which we have derived from the writings of St.
Paul. If we compare its doctrine with that of the first two
Gospels, I think that in some respects it shows a distinct advance
on these. There, as herc, and also in Romans X. 17, saith cometh
by hearing, and hearing by the word of God3 it is the word sown
in the heart and carried out in the life which is the appointed
means of salvati0n3 but it is not so distinctly stated there, as it is
here, that it is God, the sole Author of all good, who of His own
will makes use of the word to quicken us to a new life. St. John
alone of the Evangelists has risen to the same height in the words
‘ As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
sons of God3 which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.’ If it be said that the
Pentecostal gift of the Spirit forms the dividing line between fully
developed and rudinientary Ohristianity, and that we have no right
to compare what professes to be a product of the one with what
professes to belong to the other; it may be answered (1) that the
Evangelists themselves wrote with a full knowledge of the later
development of Christianity, so far as it is shown in the Acts, and
(2) that a comparison with this later Christianity confirms our
previous result. St. J ames would have agreed not only with the
words ascribed to St. Peter, ‘In every action he that seareth Him
and worketh righteousness is acceptable to Him,⁷ ‘ Repent and be
baptized every 0110 of you, in the name of J esus Christ for the re-
mission of sins, and )το shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost⁷3
but also with the words ascribed to St. Paul, ‘By Him all that
believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be
justified by the law of Moses,' ‘I commend you to God and to
the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give
