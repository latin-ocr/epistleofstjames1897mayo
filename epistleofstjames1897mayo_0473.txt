Gon THE AUTHOR 01· ALL Goon.

To dissipate entirely the idea that temptation comes from God, and
that man is therefore not responsible 101· 1116 6111, St. James here gives
the positive side 01 that characteristic which he had shadowed out on
116 negative side 111 ver. 13. God is not merely Himself free from all
touch 01 evil, and therefore incapable 61 injuring others, He is absolute
Goodness, always communicating good to others, and Himself the
hidden spring 01 611 good done by others. Nor is it only moral good
that comes from Him, though that may be His most perfect gift 3 but
all light, all truth, beauty and happiness, all that at first made the
world appear good 111 the eyes 01 its Creator, is still His work, His gift.
It is vain to look for good from any other quarter‚ from the lusts 61
the fiesh, or the smiles 61 the world. Man, however, by his own sin
raises up a cloud which hides from him the 1666 01 G0d3 and thus he
comes to picture to himself 6 God who is no longer loving, but stern,
vindictive, jealous 01 human happiness. Such an imagination is a
(1611161011 01 the devil. Even this material sun does not cease to shine
behind the cloud which hides it from human view 3 and God’s
love, more unchanging 111611 the brightness 01 the sun, knows no
eclipse. In all worlds He is eternaHy the same, the giver 01 611 good,
who cannot do otherwise than will what is best for every one of His
creatures. His purpose for us Christians is that we should be the
first-fruits, the sample and earnest, 01 Η16 new creation. Through us
He reveals to the world what He would have all men to be. And the
means by which He renews in us the divine image, which is the true
nature of man, is the declaration 01 Η16 love, made first through the
Son, and then further explained and enforced by those whom the Son
has sent to sow the good seed 01 the kingdom. The teaching 01 Christ
rightly received into the beart constitutes the germ 01 6 new divine
life, by which it is the will 01 God that humanity 66 6 whole should
in the end be permeated and transfused.l

It shows how liable men are to be deluded by phrases, that Luther,
with this passage before him, could imagine the teaching 01 St. J ames
to be opposed to that of St. Paul. ‘By grace are we saved through
saith, and that not 61 yourselves, it 16 the gift of God ⁷ is not a stronger
