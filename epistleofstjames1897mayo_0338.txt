58 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

τροπῆς &vocatae-pa] The AN. ‘ shadow of turning,' though supported
by the Old Latin modicum obumbrationis and by the Greek commentators
and lexicographers and by Ewald in modern times, is undoubtedly wrong.
The simple word σκιά may take this colloquial sense, as in Philo M. 1. p.
606 πεπιστευκὼς ἰ’χνος ἢ σκιὰνῆ ὥραν ἀπιστίας δέχεται, Demosth. 552. 7 εἴ
γε εἶχε στιγμὴν ἦ σκιὰν τούτων, but it is impossible that this should be the
case With a ἅπ. λεγ. like ἀποσκίασμα. The cognate ἀποσκιασμός occurs
Plut. Perz‘cl. 6 γνωμόνων ἀποσκιασμούς of shadows thrown on the
dial, and ἀποσκιάζω Plato Bel). vii. 532 O. Taking the word by itself we
naturally think of the nioon losing its borrowed light as it passes under
the shadow of the earth. But the sun, the source of light, though it
may be hidden from us by the interposition of some other body, cannot
itself be overshadowed. So St. John tells us (l ep. i. 5) ὃ Θεὸς φῶς
ἐστὶ καὶ σκοτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδεμία.

The word τροπή is only found here in NT. 3 it is used of the
heavenly movements 111 LXX. Dent. xxxiii. 14 καθ’ ὥραν γεννημάτων
ἡλίου τροπῶν, Job. xxxviii. 33 ἐπίστασαι τροπὰς οὐρανοῦ, also in Wisd.
vii, 18 (God gave me to know) σύστασιν κόσμου καὶ 1,ἐνέργειαν στοιχείων,
τροπῶν ἀλλαγὰς καὶ μεταβολὰς καιρῶν, ἐνιαυτοῦ κύκλους καὶ ἀστέρων θέσεις,
where it has its usual technical meaning ‘ solstices.’ The RV„ in agree-
ment with Gebser, Wiesinger‚ Alf„ Beyschlag, Erdmann, translates
‘ shadow that is cast by turning,’ which Alf. explains as referring to ‘the
revolution in which the heavens are ever found, by means of which the
moon turns her dark side to us . . . . is eclipsed by the shadow of the
earth, and the sun by the body of the moon.’ But what a singular way
of describing this to say that it is an overshadowing which comes from
turning or change of position 1 ‘ Overshadowing of one another]
ἀλλήλων ἀποσκίασμα, would have been what we should have expected.
Accordingly Schneckenburger and De Wette (Briickner> have rightly
felt that τροπή must be taken here in another and far more usual sense,
that of ‘ change in general ⁷ (like τύχης τροπαί Plut. lllor. p. 611, γνώμης
τροπή ib. Vit. 410 F), since, as the latter says, ‘schwierig ist damit
(1.6. with the idea of revolution) ἀποσκίασμα 111 Verbindung zu bringen.'
The liability of all that is created to change (Anton. vi. 23 τὰ
ὄντα ἐν μυρίαις τροπαῖς, καὶ σχεδὸν οὐδὲν ἑστός, ὦ. viii. 6 πάντα τροπαί)
is continually contrasted in Philo with the immutability of the
Creator : cf. M. 1. p. 72 πᾶν τὸ ’γεννητὸν ἀναγκαῖον τρέπεσθαι· ἴδιον
γάρ ἐστι τοῦτο, ὥσπερ Θεοῦ τὸ ἄτρεπτον εἶναι, il). 82 πῶς ἅν τις πισ-
τεύσαι Θεῷ,· ἐὰν μαθῇ ὅτι πάντα τὰ ἄλλα τρέπεται, μόνος δὲ αὐτὸς
ἅτρεπτός ἐστι, and (with a still closer resemblance to our text)
ib. p. SC' ὅταν ἁμάρτῃ καὶ ἀμαρτηθῇ ὁ νοῦς ἀρετῆς, αἰτιᾶται τὰ θεῖα, τὴν ἰδίαν
τροπὴν προσάπτων Θεῷ. Many similar passages will be found in the
treatises Ley. Alley. and Cherub. Cf. too Oleni. Al. Strom. i. 418 P. τὸ
ἑστὼς καὶ μόνιμον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τὸ ἄτρεπτον αὐτοῦ φῶς. From this opposi-
tion to the Divine nature the word τροπή gets a second connotation
implying moral frailty, as in Philo p. 72 ἀντιφιλονεικεῖ μοι ἡ τροπή, καὶ
πολλάκις βουλόμενος καθῆκόν τι νοῆσαι ἐπαντλοῧμαι ταῖς παρὰ τὸ καθῆκον
ἐπιῤῥοίαις, ib. 188 ὁ Θεοῦ θεραπευτὴς αἰώνιον ἐλευθερίαν κεκάρπωται, κατὰ
τὰς συνεχεῖς τροπὰς τῆς ἀεικινήτου ψυχῆς ἰάσεις δεχόμενος ἐπαλλήλους. . ,τῆς
