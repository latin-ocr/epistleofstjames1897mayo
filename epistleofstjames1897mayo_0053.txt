by His presence should not thenceforth have borne any offspring of
man.' So we find Pearson (Croesi, p. 3:26) citing in proof of the
ἀειπαρθενία Ezek. xliv. 2 ‘This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
opened, and no man shall enter in by it3 because the Lord, the
God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.’
It would surely have been more to the purpose to cite the words
of the Messianic psalm (lxix. 8) ‘ I have become a stranger to my
brethren and an alien to my morsm-'s children) this psalm being
used to illustrate the earthly life of our Lord both by St.41011n,
‘ The zeal of thy house has eaten me up; they gave me also gall
for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink,' and
by St. Luke, ‘Let their habitation be desolate.' Whether these
sentiments of the Fathers are to be regarded as something in-
dependent of the idea of the impurity of marriage or as a natural
offshoot of it, which I should be rather inclined to believe, is not
of much importance. The only question worth considering is:
Are these sentiments so authoritative as to justify us in twisting
the words of the Scripture narrative and giving to them a non-
natural sense 2 This question I shall endeavour to answer in the
next section.

(4) It is ‘the tendency‚’ says Dr. Mill (lx. p. 301), ‘of the
Christian mystery, God manifest in the flesli, when heartily
received, to generate an unwillingness to believe that the womb
thus divinely honoured should have given birth to other merely
human progeny.' ‘The sentiment of veneration for this august
vessel of grace which has ever animated Christians . . . could not
have been wanting to the highly-favoured Joseph? ‘On the
impossibility of refuting these sentiments . . . the truly Catholic
Christian will have pleasure in reposing! So Epiphanius, J erome,
and other ancient writers speak of this as a ‘ pious belief,’ and the
same is reiterated by Hammond and J eremy Taylor cited by Mill
(p. 309). In answer to this Ι would say that unless we are pre-
pared to admit all the beliefs of the mediaeval Ohurch‚ we must
beware of allowing too much authority to pious opinions. Is there
any extreme of superstition which cannot pleafl a ‘pious opinion’
in its favour? Of course it is right in studying history, whether
sacred or profane, to put ourselves in the position of the actors, to
imagine how they must have felt and acted; but this is not quite

the same thing as imagining how we ourselves should have felt and
