clviii INTRODU OTION

law of bondage. So, too, Harnack‚ ‘ Law with this writer is not
the Mosaic law in its concrete character, but a sort of essence of
law which he has distilled for himself ⁷ (p. 486).

The incident referred to is not quite correctly stated. It is not
5311165 himself, but ‘ certain from James ’ (Gal. ii. 12), whose
presence had this baneful effect on Peter and the other Jews.
That they did not represent the real feeling of St. 5311165 15 not
only probable from the fact that the responsible leaders of a partyv
are usually less extreme than their followers, but it is also expressly
stated, if we accept the account given in Acts XV. 24 ; for there we
read that 5311165 had previously had to complain of unauthorized
persons speaking in his name (τινὲς ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐξελθόντες ἐτάραξαν
ὑμός λόγοις . . . λέγοντες περιτέμνεσθαι καὶ τηρεῖν τὸν
νόμον, οἷς ου’ διεστειλάμεθα). 5311165 was certainly included in
the number of those who sanctioned the conduct of St. Peter in
eating with Cornelius (Acts xi. 1-3, 18), and later on (xxi. 20) we
find him explaining to Paul 1116 difficulty he had in controlling the
zealots of his party, the converted Pharisees of xv, 5. There is
nothing in the N ew Testament to suggest that he was an extreme
legalist. Even tradition goes no further than to show that his own
practice was ascetic: it does not state that he enforced this practice
on others. When Harnack says he invented a law of his own
(‘ ein Gesetz welches er sich destillirt hat'), he seems to 1116 to
shut his eyes to the main factor in the history. If the author was
really the brother of Jesus, brought up with Him from infancy,
and acknowledging Him as Messiah before His departure from
earth, he must have been greatly influenced by His teaching, as
indeed is abundantly shown in the Epistle. What then was
Christ's teaching as to the law? Ι make no reference to the
Fourth Gospel, as the discourses there may be supposed to be
coloured by the reporter‚ but in the Sernion on the Mount we see
the law of the letter changed to a law of the spirit. The law of
love to God and love to inan is described as the great command--
ment on which hang all the law and the prophets. Men are
called to bear Christ⁷s easy yoke and light burden, as opposed to
those heavy burdens which the scribes, sitting in Moses' seat, lay
upon men's shoulders, and of which Peter afterwards declared that
‘neither our fathers nor we were able to bear them? How was it
possible that the brother of the Lord should seek to reimpose such
a yoke? Harnack and Julicher write as if Christianity began
