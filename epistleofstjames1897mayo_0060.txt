111 INTRODUOTION

those who were versed in the laws were indignant at this and made complaints
both to King Agrippa and to Albinus on the ground that Ananus had no right
to summon the Sanhedrin without the consent of the procurator, · and that
Agrippa in consequence removed him from the 111811 priesthood. 1

Orio· ›en (Cels. i. p. 35 Spencer) and Ε11· ebius (H..E ii. 23) also cite Josephus
as 68611111118 1116 1111861168 01 1116 siege to the divine veng 661166 101 1116 111111(161 01

Bishop Lightfoot’s comments on the preceding (Le. pp. :366 and ’
330) are worth quoting.‘-' Of the account given by Josephus he
says: ‘ It is probable in itself, which the account in Hegesippus is
not, and is such as Josephus might be expected to write, 11 116
touched on the matter at all. His stolid silence about Christianity
elsewhere cannot be owing to ignorance, for a sect which had been
singled out for years before he wrote, as a mark 101 imperial
vengeance at Rome, must have been only too well known in
J udaea. On the other hand, if the passage had been a Christian
interpolation, the notice of Janres would have been more lauda-
tory, as is actually the case in the spurious addition read by Origen
and Eusebius? Of Hegesippus he says: ‘His account presents
some striking resemblances with the portion of the Clementine
Recognitions conjectured to be taken from the Ebionite Ἀναβαθ-
μοὶ Ἰακώβου (so called as describing the ascents of «1611168 up the
temple stairs, whence he harangued the people): and we may
hazard the conjecture that the story 01 1116 martyrdom, to which
Hegesippus is indebted, was the grand finale of these “Ascents.''
The Recognitions record how James refuted the Jewish sects3
Hegesippus makes the conversion of certain 01 111686 86618 1116
starting-point of the persecution which led to his nrartyrdom. In
the Recognitions he is thrown down the flight 01 steps and left as
dead by his 1161866111018, but is taken up alive by the brethren: in ’

1 861111161·<«Ῑσῑι·1871Ρ ο21ῖσ, vol. ii. 186 foll. Eng. Tr.) gives what to 1116 appears
a very singular reason for rejecting pthis date. The passage, he says, has probably
suffered 110111 Christian interpolation, since Origen read it differently from 0111 text,
as 681661118 with Hegesippus' 111 bringing the death 01 lanies into 61086 relation with
the fall ot Jerusalem. But if thereou 616 811611 interpolation, its object 1111181 81116157
have been to magnify the importance 01 James' nrartyrdorn and make it tlre 1111-

plain tlrerwesoie that the inconsistent date (62 A. D >cannot have formed a part 01
the interpolation. ι16101116 Z. e. says that (lem. Α1., 1111118 Hypof. bk. xii„ gave the
same date as Josephus. In 4ozt. xx. 9. 6 Josephus 68818118 6 different cause for the
