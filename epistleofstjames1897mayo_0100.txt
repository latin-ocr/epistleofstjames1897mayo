(4) GREEK PHILOSOPHERS.

While the more general resemblances between the philosophers
and the Bible are no doubt to be explained on St. Paul's principle
of the law written in the heart (Rom. ii. 15), yet there is probably
more to be said on behalf of the view that the former may have
been influenced, directiy or indirect]y‚ by Jewish teaching, than is
generally recognized in the present day. I think there can be no
doubt that some of the touches in Virgil's fourth Eclogue are
derived from Isaiah through the Sibylline forgeries3 and Sir A.
Grant and Bishop Lightfoot have both called attention to the fact
that several of the Stoios came from the East. On the other hand
it is certain that the Jews after the time of Alexander were much
influenced by Greek thought, as we see in the Book of Wisdom,
the 4th Book of Maccabees, and above all in Philo. Possibly the
parallels that follow are to be explained as reminiscences of Greek
Philosophy filtered down through the writings of some Hellenistic
Jew; but Ι would not exclude the possibility that Stoic parallels
in St. J ames may have been taken directly from such a writer as
Posidonius. I have given occasional references to post-Augustan
authors, because the later Stoics borrow so much from their
predecessors. Perhaps the parallels from Lucian and Porphyry
should rather be regarded as taken directly from Christian sources.
