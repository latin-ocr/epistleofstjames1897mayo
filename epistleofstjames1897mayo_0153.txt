ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxiii

ditions. This view 15 confirmed by the fact that 110 traice of our epistle is to
be found throughout the 2nd century. Hegesippus knows nothing of an
epistle of Jaines. The supposed reminiscences in Clement of Alexandria are
just as likely to be reminiscences of Philo or Peter or Clement of Rome.
Origen is the first to mention the epistle, without however accepting its
genuineness, as is evident from his comment on Matthew xiii. 55, in which he
gives some account of the Lord's brothers and refers to the epistle of Jude, but
not to that of James.

on the Externa] Evidence for the Authenticity of the Epistle, and writers of
ask whether the quotations there given from Clement of Rome and ωέἶιῗιῗιρῗγῃξί
others are not sufficient evidence that our Epistle was known in the
first century3 whether the quotations from Ignatius, Polycarp,
Justin Martyr‚ the Ep. ad Diognetum, Irenaeus, above all Hermas,
are not such as to prove that our Epistle was studied by these writers
in the second century; whether any one with the smallest particle
of historical sense or literary feeling could for a moment dream
that the author of the Shepherd was prior to, or contemporary with,
the writer of our Epistle; whether the fact that Origen‚ having
other things of more interest to tell about 81. «10111105, 0111115 10
mention that he wrote this Epistle (as he also omits to mention
that he presided over the Council at Jerusalem), while he mentions
the Epistle of 81. J ude, because about St. J ude he has nothing else
to tell—whether, I say, this fact gives the slightest ground for
supposing that Origen doubted the authority of an Epistle, which
he over and over again cites as Scriptum, and as written by J ames,
the brother of the Lord.
Let us hear next what Von Soden has to say on the relation of

our Epistle to other books of the New Testament.

The writer is acquainted with the epistle to the Romans and the first epistle
10 the Corinthians. The tone is similar to that in the Hebrews, though there
is no literary connexion between them. On the other hand it is partly copied
from the lst of Peter. The isolated resemblances to the Apocalypse prove
nothing. It is closely connected with the Gospel and Acts of Luke, having
the same Ebionite leaning, and giving the words of Christ in the same form,
while there seems no trace of the special tradition of Mattheus, such as we find
in section v, 17-vi. 13 of his Gospel (except for the injunction as to swearfflg).
There is however no direct copying from the Gospels. With 1110 writings of
John there is no kind of connexion. The writer is acquainted with the
LXX„ but betrays no knowledge of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.
He is well acquainted with the sapientiai books of the Apocrypha and
ivith Philo. There are also signs of his having some knowledge of Greek
iterature.
