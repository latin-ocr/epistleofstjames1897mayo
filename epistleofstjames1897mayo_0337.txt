more connected with the general meaning of the passage, though the
remainder of this verse continues the inetaphor drawn from light in
the literal sense. Compare Matt. V. 14 ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου,

foot translates ‘there is no place for,² and notes that ‘not the fact
only, but the possibility’ is negatived. He approves Buttman’s view
given by WViner, p. 96) that ἔνι ‘is not a contraction from ἔνεστι, but
the preposition ἐν, ἐνί, strengthened by a more vigorous accent, like ἔπι,
πάρα, and used With an ellipsis of the substantive verb.’ In 1 Cor. vi.
5 οὐκ ἔνι ἐν ὑμῖν οὐδεὶς σοφός the word has a Weaker force, as often in

ἐν παραλλαγῇ ‘furiously⁷ 2 Kings ix. 20 3 of the succession of beacon-
light& Ayam. 490. Its general sense is the same as that of thev
v, παραλλάσσω, denoting variation from a set course, rule 01· pattern,
as in Plut. Mor. 1039 B, Epict. Dz‘ss. i. 14 (referring to the changes of
the seasons) πόθεν πρὸς τὴν αὔξησιν καὶ μείωσιν τῆς σελήνης καὶ τὴν τοῦ·
ἡλίου πρόσοδον καὶ ἄφοδον τοσαύτη παραλλαγὴ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἐναντία μεταβολὴ

μηδεμίαν εἶναι παραλλαγὴν κάλλους πρὸς αἶσχος. Some commentators
have thought it to be a vox teclmicco of ειεῖιόῃοῐῃγεπαράλλαξις, our
‘ parallax,' but no instance of such a use is quoted. It is true it is a
favourite word with the astronomer Geminus (contained in Petavius’
Uranoloyion)‚ but he uses it quite generally of the varying length of the
day &a 3 cf. p. 26 Β ἀκολουθεῖ δὲ τούτῳ καὶ παραλλαγὴν τῶν ἡμερῶν μεγά-
λην γίνεσθαι διὰ τὴν τῶν τμημάτων ὑπεροχὴν ὧν φέρεται ὃ ἥλιος ὑπὲρ γῆν (ίθ.
the length of the day varies according to the sun's elevation). Other
instances are cited by Gebser p. 83. We may therefore take the word
to express the contrast between the natural sun, which varies its
position in the sky from hour to hour and month to mouth, and the
eternal Source of all light. A similar contrast is found in Epict. Diss.
i. 14. 10 ἀλλὰ φωτίζειν μὲν οἷός τε ἐστὶν ὃ ἥλιος τηλικοῦτον μέρος τοῦ
