ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxlv

Schwegler and Briickner (p. 877). 011 1110 main point, however,
he holds to the T'ubingen view, that the Epistle was written in the
latter half of the second century, his chief argument being that it
bears traces of being written after the Epistle to the Romans, the
151 of St. Peter, 'and Hermas.

I will not here repeat what Ι have said before as 10 1110 mutual
relations of the above—named Epistles, but will simply state the
general principles which I think ought 10 determine our judgment
in this and similar cases. Where it is agreed that there is a direct
literary connexion between two writers, A and B, treating of the
same subject from apparently opposite points of vieW‚ and using
the same illustrations, if it shall appear that the argument of B
meets in all respects the argument of A, while the argument of A
has no direct reference to that of B, the priority lies with A.
Again where it is agreed that there is a connexion between two
writers, treating of the same subject, on the same scale, from the
sanie point of view, and using the same quotations, it is probable
that the writer who gives the thought in its most terse and rugged
form, and takes least trouble to be precise in the wording of his
quotations is the earlier writer. Usiug these 10515, Ι venture to
· think that it has been proved conclusively, that the Epistle of St.
<lanies is prior to the first Epistle of St. Peter and to that of St. Paul
to 1110 Romans3 and this one fact is sufficient to upset the whole
house of cards erected by Pfleiderer. Supposing however that the
priority of James to Paul were still a matter of doubt, Ι should
not be at all more inclined to admit the possibility of our Epistle
having been written at the late date assigned to it by Pfleiderer.
None of his arguments seems to me to be of such a nature as we
should rely on, if it were a question about secular writers. Take
for instance 1115 assertion that Hermas was prior to J ames. From a
literary point of view, this seems to me on a par with saying that
Quintus Smyrnaeus is prior to Homer, or Apuleius 10 Cicero. But
on what does he ground the assertion? ‘That which occurs in an
aphoristic form in J ames, is found in its natural context in
Hermas' (p. 868). As examples he gives J ames iv. 7, ‘Resist the
devil and he will fiee from you,' compared with lllcmcl. xii. 5
(abridged), where Hermas says, ‘ Man desires to keep the commands
of God, but the devil is strong and overcomes him? The angel
answers, ‘The devil cannot overcome the servants of God who place
