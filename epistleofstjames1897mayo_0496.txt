St. James, following the books of Job and of Proverbs and the
sapientia] books of the Apocrypha, has already spoken of wisdom as
the gift of God, which we are to seek by earnest prayer, and which
will enable the Christian to understand the purpose of the trials to
which he is exposed, and to make the right use of them (i. 3). In the
O. T. the word has a very wide sense, including both science and
literature (l Kings iv. 29-34, Prov. i. 6), but laying most stress on
practica] wisdom, of which the foundation is said to be the fear of the
Lord. Here it is introduced as a seque] to the instructions to
teachers, especially religious teachers, and is defined by the moral
qualifications which go to the making of a good teacher or student.
Freedom from personal objects, single-minded devotion to the pursuit
of truth, simplicity‚ modesty—these qualities are essential to students
in whatever department of thought. Gentleness and sympathy,
appreciation for the work of others—these qualities are essential to a
persuasive teacher. So much we shall all admit 3 but it may be asked,
Is wisdom nothing more than this to St. James2 If we test his
description of wisdom by applying it to the case of men who are
universally esteemed wise, a Thucydides, a Plato, a Shakespeare 3 or to
an Athanasius, or a Pascal, or a Bishop Butler 3 even to St. Paul or
St. John, do we find that it supplies us with anything like an
exhaustive analysis of what we know as wisdom in them2 It
evidently takes no account of the original powers of the mind, or of
the strictly intellectual training needed for the full development of those
powers. It is as suited to the ordinary Sunday School teacher as to the
highest genius. So far, we may regard this exhortation of St. J ames
as illustrating the Christian freedom from exclusiveness. The
Gospel addresses itself to the Publican as well as to the Pharisee, to
‘this people that knoweth not the law' as well as to the doctor and
the scribe. Every one has some mental powers: wisdom consists in
the right use of those powers, be they small or great. But there is
no reason to suppose that St. James intended to give a complete
exposition of his ideas on wisdom in this passage. He is simply
dealing With the evils incident to the religious teaching of the time.
