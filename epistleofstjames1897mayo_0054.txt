acted under their circumstances, until at least we have done our
best to strip off all that differentiates the mind of one century from
the mind of another. If we could arrive at the real feeling of
Joseph in respect to his wife, and of Mary in respect to her Son
before and after his birth, this would undoubtedly be an element of
the highest importance for the determination of the question before
us: but to assume that they must have felt as a monk, or nun, or
celibate priest of the Middle Ages3 to assume even, with Dr. Mill,
that they fully understood the mystery ‘God manifest in the fiesh‚'
is not merely to make an unauthorized assumption, it is to assume
what is palpably contrary to fact.

coming of the Messiah, the prophet like unto Moses who would
speak the words of God to the people, the Prince of the house of
David, who would not merely judge the heathen and restore again
the glories of Solonion, but would sit as a refiner and purifier of
silvei· and purify the sons of Levi themselves, and yet one who
would bear the sins of many and make intercession for the trans-

¹ Cf. the language of Mary‘s kinswoman Elizabeth in Luke i. 25, and Lightfoot,
Coloss. p. 139, ‘The Talmudic writings teem with passages implying not only the
superior sanctity, but even the imperative duty of marriage. The words of Gen. i.
28 were regarded not merely as a promise, but as a command, which was binding
upon all. It is a maxim of the Talmud that “Any Jew who has not a wife is no
man'’ (Υεῦαοηοίῖι, 63 a). The fact indeed is so patent, that any accumulation of
examples would be superfluous, and Ι shall content myself with referring to Pesackim,
113 a, b, as fairly illustrating thc doctrine of orthodox Judaism on this point⁷ ; ib.
pp. 168, 9, ‘ The early disciples in the mother Church of Jerusalem show Pharisaic
but not Essene sympathies. It was altogether within the sphere of orthodox Judaism
that the J ewish elemcnt in the Christian brotherhood found its scope.’ Cf. also C.
Taylor, Lcclum‘s on alze Dldaclze, pp. 86—88.

‘2 See Ryle and James, P-sast of Solomon, p. lii. (speaking of the 17th Psalm):
‘It may be taken, we believe, as presenting, more accurately than any other
document, a statement of the popular Pharisaic expectation regarding the Messiah,
shortly before the time when our Lord Jesus, the Christ, appeared.’ Among the
characteristics of the Messiah's rule there given, it is stated that ‘He is to be a
descendant- of David‚' that His Mission is of a twosold character, destructive ·
towards Gentiles and sinners, restorative as regards Israel: His rule is spiritual,
holy, wise, and just: ‘all his subjects will be sons of God, all will be holy,‘ cf.
PS. xvii. 35 καὶ αὐτὸς βασιλεὺς δίκαιος καὶ διδακτὸε ὑπὸ Θεοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτούς. καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
