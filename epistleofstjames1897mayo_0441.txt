v 12] Nemes 161

αἰδούμενος μὴ ἀληθεύειν, ἀνάξιόν τε ‹zi-ros) καὶ ψεύδεσθαι γινώσκων, τῇ
συνειδήσει τῇ θείᾳ καὶ τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ἀρκεῖται μόναις...ταύτῃ δὲ ούδὲ ὄμνυσιν
ὅρκον ἀπαιτηθείς, Orig. on Jerem. iv. 2 (where Israel is bidden to
swear righteously and truly) says τάχα πρῶτον δεῖ ὀμόσαι ἐν ἀληθείᾳ
...ἵνα μετὰ τοῦτο προκόψας τις ἄξιος γένηται τοῦ μὴ ὀμνύειν ὅλως ἀλλ’
ἔχῃ ναὶ μὴ δεόμενον μαρτύρων τοῦ εἶναι τὸ ναί (Lomm. vol. XV. p. 166),
Ohrysost. Hom. viii. ι’)ι, Aac. (ap. Suic. ii. 510) χαλινὸν ἐπιθῶμεν τῇ
γλώττῃ· μηδεὶς ὀμνύτω τὸν Θεόν, Photius Epist. i. 34 ὁ δὲ εύσταθὴς καὶ
μεγαλόψυχος ἀνὴρ αἰσχυνθήσεται τοὺς λόγους ὅρκῳ πιστοὺς ἀποφαίνειν καὶ
τὴν διὰ τῶν οἰκείων τρόπων πίστιν ἀτιμάζειν, Theodoret Epic. div. decr. 16.
ὁ μὲν παλαιὸς νόμος ἀπαγορεύει τὸ ψεῦδος, ὂ δέ γε νέος καὶ τὸν ὅρκον.
Tertullian is inconsistent, denying the lawfulness of oaths in [dol. xi.
taceo (Ze peojurio, quando ne jurare quidem liceat, but allowing it in
Apol. 33 sed ec juramus sic, ut non per yenios Caesarum, ita per salutem
eoram. For a further discussion see Oomment below,

st. Augustine has some interesting remarks on this verse (Servi.
180). He had always, he says, shrunk from taking it as the subject
of a sermon, but as it came in the lesson for the day he felt it
his duty to offer some explanation. He sees no harm in oaths if
it were not for the danger of committing per-jury. They are some-
times required in order to induce belief of an important matter, but
as they are certainly too common, it is better to keep on the safe
side and avoid them altogether. What especially puzzles him is the
(aitte omnia. ⁴ Is swearing worse than stealing or adultery‘l We must
reg-ard it as a hyperbolic-al phrase used to add weight to the apostolic
injunction.’ The truer explanation of the πρὸ πάντων is to limit the
comparison to what immediately precedes. St. James is not thinking
of offences against the moral law generally, but only of those modes of
expressing impatience of which he had spoken in the preceding verses
μὴ στενάζετε, dcc„ Cf. l Pet. iV. 8 πρὸ πάντων τὴν εἷς ἑαυτοὺς ἀγαπὴν ἐκτενῆ
ἔχοντες, where this precept is compared with the preceding σωφρονήσατε
καὶ νήψατε, not with the first and great commandment, ‘Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God.' It must be confessed however that we might
rather have expected the angry feeling of injustice to have expressed
itself in curses than in oaths. The latter seem rather to betoken
irreverence and a low tone as to ordinary truthfulness‚ which would
have come more naturally in speaking of the sins of traders in iv. 13,
cf. Clem. Al. Paecl. 3. ξ 79, p. 299 Ρ. ἐπαίτιος δὲ ὅρκος περὶ πάντων τοῦ
πωλουμένου ἀπέστω, and Tert. Iclol. xi. B. Weiss thinks there is a
reference to the asseverations made before the judge of ver. 6. For
examples of hasty, irreverent oaths see 1 Sam. xxvi. 16, 2 Kings V. 20.
Still the oath supplies a heightened form of expression for almost any
feeling, and especially in the case of angry threats, cf. Philo M. 2. p.
271 cited above. For construction of ὀμνύω cf. Hos. iv. 15 μὴ ὀμνύετε
Κύριονε the acc. is common also in classical writers, Other construc-
tions are with κατά, εἰς, ἐν. For position of δέ see Index av.

μήτε τὸν οὐρανὸν μήτε τῆν γῆν] Both are referred to in Matt. v. 34, 35,
where, as also in Matt. xxiii. 16 foll„ other common forms of swearing
are specified.
