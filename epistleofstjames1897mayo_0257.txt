of whom were HellenistS, instructed in the wisdom of Alexandria,
then the natural bent would take the shape of duty: he would be
a student of Greek in order that he might be a more effective
instructor to his own people.1 The 1130 of rare compounds, to
which the Bishop calls attention, is certainly remarkable; bnt I
am not sure that it is most easily explained by his supposition of
the employinent of a professional interpreter. A man of ability,
who has to express himself in a foreign tongue, which he has
learnt partly from books, is not unlikely to be insensible to the
distinction between the language of poetry and prose, and to eke
out his limited resources by combining familiar roots. I think
this might be illustrated from the style of the book of YVssdom,
and froin the English writings of foreigners, e.g. Kossuth’s Specclccs.

It appears to me then (l) that the phenomena of the Greek
epistle, which goes under the name of St. dames, are strongly
against its being a translation ; (2) that the writer was acquainted
with the Greek books of the Apocrypha and with the principles of
the Stoic philosophy3 (3) that the balance of probability is in
favour of St. J ames having been able to write Greek, but that this
need not preclude us from supposing that he may have availed
himself of the assistance of a Hellenist ‘brother' in revising his
Epistle. A fourth reason which indisposes 1110 10 accept the
hypothesis of an Aramaic original is the fact of its disappearance
without leaving any trace behind. The existing Syriac version of
St. J ames is generally supposed to 110 a translation from the Greek3
and ‘it 13 significant that the Edessene scribes do not seem to
recognize any tradition that the Epistle was written in any languag'e
but Greek. As far as I know, they content themselves with the
title “Epistle of James the Apostle.'' One ancient MS. however
in the Brit. Mus. adds to the subscription “which he wrote from
„Jerusalem” ⁷ (G. H. Gwilliam).

With regard to the inferences drawn from the peculiarities ol
the Corbey version, it may be worth while to compare the varia-
tions in the Peshitto‚ whether regarded as witnessing to the

¹ It may be worth while to note that Jalnes is mentioned by an ancient writer as
the translator of the original Hebrew of St. Matthew's Gospel into Greek, see the
Synopsis Scripturae Sacrae included in the writings of Athanasius (Migne‚ vol. iv.
p. 432) τὸ μὲν οὖν κατὰ Ματθαΐον εὐαγγέλιον ἐγράφη ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦ Ματθαίου τῇ
Ἐβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ...ἣρμηνεύθη δὲ ὑπὸ Ἰακώβου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου τὸ κατὰ σάρκα,
ιὸς καὶ πρῶτος ἐχειροτονήθη ἐπίσκοπος ὑπὸ τῶν ἁγίων ἀποστόλων ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις.
Probably this was only a guess suggested by the resemblance between our Epistle
and St. Matthew⁷s Gospel.
