II 13-15] NOTEs 93

ἃ μὲν χρὴ διανοεῖσθαι ἔργοις δὲ ἀτόποις καὶ λόγοις χρῆσθαι; and p. 295,
320, M 2. p. 333, also by Plato and Xen. The only other place in
which the word occurs in NT. is 1 Cor. xv, 32 εἰ κατ’ ἄνθρωπον ἐθηριο-
μάχησα, τί μοι τὸ ὄφελος,-

ἕργα.] The ἔλεος of ver. 13. Cf. Clem. Hom. viii. ’ἶ οὐ γὰρ ὠφελήσει
τινὰ τὸ λέγειν ἀλλὰ τὸ ποιεῖν· ἐκ παντὸς οὖν τρόπου καλῶν ἔργων χρεία, Pirke
Aboth ‘ say little, (10 much' (Taylor J. F. p. 38). Philo M. 1. p. 525 ἡ
ἄνευ πράξεως θεωρία ψιλὴ πρὸς οὐδὲν ὄφελος τοῖς ἐπιστήμοσιν.
⁴ μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόνς] The interrogative μή, expeeting Of
course a negative answer, occurs again below iii. 12, and is very fre-
quent in the 1st epistle to the Corinthians and the Gospel of St. John.
For σῶσαι cf. i. 21 : it is the triumph of mercy over judgment of ver.
13. ἡ πίστις not faith absolutely, but such saith as this, fides villa
quam rcos habere dicitis (Rode).

15. ἐὰν ἁδελφός] See n. on i. 2. If δέ is inserted after ἐάν we should
have to consider this a second parallel case, in which profession is
opposed to reality3 but it makes better sense to omit it with B. and
Sin. and take this as a concrete illustration of the abstract principle
> stated in ver. 14. Compare 1 John iii. 17, 18 (where the empty pro-
fession of love is contrasted with the living reality), Philo M. 1. p. 527
ὥσπερ ἐν ἰατροῖς ἡ λεγομένη λογοῖατρειά πολὺ τῆς τῶν καμνόντων ὠφελείας
ἀποστατεῖ, φαρμάκοις γὰρ καὶ χειρουργίαις καὶ διαίταις οἰλλ1 οὐ λόγοις αἶ
νόσοι θεραπεύονται κ.τ.λ. For construction Of ἐὰν γυμνοὶ ὓπάρχωσιν...εἷπη
δέ τις...μὴ δῶτε δέ Compare ver. 2 above ἐὰν εἷσέλθῃ...ει’σε’λθῃ δέ...
ἐπιβλέψητε δέ.

γυμνοί,] Ηο still has before him the case of the poor who were
slighted in the congregation. The word does not necessarily imply
absolute nakedness ε a person wearing only the emonem, or under-tunic
(χιτωνίσκος 01· ὗποδύτης), was described as naked ε thus it is used
of Saul after having taken off his Upper garments (1 Sam. xix. 24),
of a warrior who has cast off his military cloak (Amos ii. 16), of Peter
without his fisher⁷s coat (e’ffevssv'rvys) ; cf. too Hesiod Op. 391 γυμνὸν
σπείρειν imitated in Geory. i. 299. The same expression is applied to
the poorly clad in Job xxii. 6, Isa. lviii. 7, Matt. xxv, 36, see D. qf B.
ἣν. ⁶ Dress' p. 454.

λειπόμενοι] See oni. 4. AS the best MSS. omit ὦσιν, this must be
taken With ὑπάρχωσιν, Cf. Acts viii. 16 βεβαπτισμένοι ὑπῆρχον. The
plural is of course not strictly grammatica] after the disjunctive con-
junction, but it is a very natural irregularity,- cf. Plato Ley. 8. 838
ὅταν ἀδελφὸς ἦ ἀδελφή τῳ γένωνται καλοί, Krueg. Gr. ξ 63. 3. 2. So a
singular subject followed by μετά with gen. is sometimes joined with a
plural verb z see below on δῶτε.

ἑῲημέρου.] Only here in N.T. ; not in LXX. Diod. iii. 31, Dion. H.
viii. 41 and Aristides xlix. 537, 631, use the phrase ἐφήμερος τροφή,
Ρ11110 M. 2, p. 538 has τὸ ἐφήμερον, probably quoted from a comio poet
(πένητές ἐσμεν καὶ μόλις τούφήμερον εἷς αὐτὰ τάναγ-
κ αἶα πορίζειν δυνάμεθα). Field cites Ael. V.H. iii. 29 Diogenes said he
was πτωχὸς δυσείμων, βίον ἔχων τὸν ἐφήμερον, Menander p. 134 Μ. στρα-
τεία δ’ οὗ φέρει περιουσίαν ἐφήμερον δὲ καὶ προπετῆ βίον. It is defined by
