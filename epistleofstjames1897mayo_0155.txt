ON THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxv

tiles into the Church, being ignored in 011 epistle addressed to the Diaspora
(if written after this date). He gives us again the old argument, answered above,
that we cannot conceive first love cooling down, say, in a period 01 ten years.
He considers that it was written at a time 01 degeneracy, when the Jewish
element in the Church had lost all significance 3 that perhaps the title may
be 01101 011 genuine, because Christians had then learnt to regard themselves as
the true Israel, strangers and pilgrims in the world, waiting sor the hour 01 111011
Lord's appearing. 11 it had been really intended for Jews, there must have
been more 01 10001 colouring. The instances alleged 101 11115 local colouring

The only argument here which seems to call 101· examination is 1ῑέ ξῖᾖῡξέἓὲ

founded on the fact that the J ewish Christians are charged with rssffifagffl

laying too much stress, not on their ritual (the works of the law), btgffglgggffist

but on their orthodox belief in one God. No doubt there is a 1ζέὶὲἓέζέἒῆξὲ

striking difference between the language 01 St. J ames and the J {fl-3213 {tr-it„
language of St. Paul on this point3 a difference entirely in accord· mg to hv&
ance with all we know of 1110 two men. St. James, living among
Jews, himself practising 1110 Jewish ritual, saw 00 obj ection 10 J ewish
Christians continuing their ritual observances, 05 long 05 they
ascribed no merit 10 them. He warns his readers, however, not to
suppose that 1110 outward rite could commend them 10 God (1. 27) :
the religious service which God approved consisted in charity and
unworldliness. Is not this pcrfectly natural teaching from a Jewish
apostle to Jewish believers‚ who would at once recognize it 05 a
re-publication 01 1110 teaching of Isaiah and Micah on the same
subject? Does then the improbability consist in the assumption
that J ewish Christians were in danger 01 trusting in their orthodox
monotheism 10 1110 neglect of the perfect law 01 love? It is plain
01 any rate that if there were any people who were likely 10 pride
themselves on this belief, they must have been Jews by birth, 11οῖ
Gentiles. Moreover we know as a matter of fact 11101 Jews did
pride themselves just 00 this point, did believe that their ortho-
doxy placed them on a pinnacle above all other people‚ and was 01
115011 efficient to salvation; compare the words 01 «11151111 spoken
to 0 J ew (Tryph. p. 370 D), ‘You and others like you (220. Judaizing
Christians) deceive yourselves with words, saying that, though you
should be sinners, yet because you know God, the Lord will not
impute sin to you,' and see Lightfoot, Gal. pp. lai—164, and the
quotations in my note on ii. 19. In the same way they are rebuked
by John the Baptist and by our Lord for priding themselves on their
descent from Abraham (Matt. iii. S, 9, vii. 21-23, Luke xiii. affl-30).
