ii INTRODUCTION

while St. Peter on the contrary dwells exclusively on the example
of Christ (cf. 1 Pet. ii. 19-24, iv. 12-14). So in urging the
duty of prayer reference is made, not (as in Heb. v. 7) to the
promises or the prayers of Christ, but to the prayer of Elijah ε the
duty of kindness, and the warning against evil-speaking in ch. iii.
are based not on the example of Christ and the thought of our
common brotherhood in Him (as in 1 Pet. ii. 23, Rom. xii. 5, Eph.
iv, 25), but on the parables of nature, 011 the fact that man was
created in the image of God, and on general reasoning : and again
(in iv. 11, 12) speaking evil of a brother is condemned as putting a
slight on the Law, not as causing pain to Christ. No mention is
made of the death or resurrection of Christ, or of the doctrines of
the Incarnation and Atonement. To a careless reader the tone of
the Epistle, as a whole, seems scarcely to rise above the level of the
Old Testament3 Christian ideas are still clothed in J ewish forms.
Thus the Law, called for the sake of distinction ‘ the law of liberty'
or ‘ the royal laW,' seems to stand in place of the Gospel or even of
Christ himself (ii. 8—13, iv. 11); the love of the world is condemned
in the language of the Old Testament as adultery against God.
This contrast rises to its highest point in treating of the relation
between Faith and Works (ii. 14-26). While St. Paul writes
(Rom. iii. 28) ‘ We reckon therefore that a man is justified by saith
apart from the works of the law‚' the language of St. James is (ii.
24) ‘Ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by
saith only.' And while the case of Abraham is cited in Rom. iv.
3, 13, 16 in proof of the doctrine of justification by saith, and the
case of Rahab is cited for the same purpose in Heb. xi. 31,
St. J ames makes use of both to prove that man is justified by works
(ii. 25). Ι shall have to go more fully into these questions here-
after‚ and shall then point out s'ome considerations which will to a
certain extent qualify the first impression left on the mind by a
perusa] of the Epistle 3 but speaking generally we may safely say
that it has a more J ewish cast than any other writing of the New
Testament, and that the author must have been one who would be
more in sympathy with the Judaizing party and more likely to
exercise an influence over them than any of the three great leaders
Peter, Paul or John.

If we turn now to the Epistles of St. Paul and to the Acts of the
Apostles we find mention there of a J ames who exactly fulfils the
