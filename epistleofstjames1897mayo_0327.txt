ἐν ζωῇ βασιλεύσουσιν, Luke xii. 32 ‘ it is my Father’s good pleasure 1ο
give you the kingdom,' ib. xxii. 28 ‘ Ι appoint unto you a kingdom,
and ye shall sit on thrones judging 1116 twelve tribes of IsraeL' 2 Tim.
ii. 12 εἷ ὑπομένομεν καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν, Which reminds one Of Zech. Vi.
14 ὁ στέφανος ἔσται τοῖς ὑπομένουσι, following immediately after κατάρξει
ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, so the Stoic paradox sapiens rens. The nearest
parallels to our passage are Apoc. ii. 10 γίνου πιστὸς ἄχρι θανάτου καὶ
δώσω σοι τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς, 2 Tim. l'V. S ἀποκεῖταί μοι ὁ τῆς δικαιου
σύνης στέφανος ὃν ἀποδώσει μοι ὁ Κύριος ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ...καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς
ἠγαπηκόσι τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ, 1 Pet. V. 4 φανερωθέντος τοῦ ἀρχιποιμέιιός
κομιεῖσθε τὸν ἀμαράντινον τῆς δόξης στέφανον. Τ116 1156 of the article in
all these seems to imply some well-known saying or a'very definite
expectation. On the other hand, the idea of a kingly crown seems less
appropriate in them than that of a crown of merit or victory. The
Rabbins talk of three crowns (Pirke Aboth iv. 19). Probably the
metaphorical use would be coloured by all the literal uses. Other
instances are Sir. 1. 16, vi. 30, xv. 6, Acta Matt. Tisch. p. 169 ἐγγύς
ἐστιν τῆς ὑπομονῆς σου ὁ στέφανος, Philo Lequ. All. M. p. 86 σπούδασον
στεφανωθῆναι κατὰ τῆς τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας νικώσης ἡδονῆς καλὸν καὶ εὐκλεᾶ
στέφανον ὃν οὐδεμία πανήγυρις ἀνθρώπων ἐχώρησε.

sider that the expression is borrowed from Apoc. ii. 10, this being the
promise referred to below, [VVisdoin promises a crown and life, Prov.
iv. 9, iii. 18, Aboth vi. CIL]

ὃν ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν.] Κύριος Ol‘ Θεός is inserted in some
MSS. but in AB Sin. nbc. the subject is omitted, as in Heb. iv. 3 καθὼς
εἴρηκεν, and often in introducing a quotation: cf. iv. 6, Eph. iv, 8,
Gal. iii. 16, 1 Cor. vi. 16, Heb. x. 5, and Winer p. 7355 also without a
quotation in 1 Joh. v. 16 αἰτήσει, καὶ δώσει αὐτῷ ζωήν. Putting on one
side Apoc. ii. 10, which was probably written subsequently to this
epistle, we clo not find the precise words τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς 111
any particular passage of the Bible. It is a question therefore
whether they constitute an unwritten word, a record of oral teaching‚
such as we have in Acts XX. 35‚-and of which others have been pre-
served by early Christian writers ; 1 or whether it is an instance of
loose quotation, representing some of the verses cited above on στέφανος.
For the latter view it may be said that it is apparently the same quo-
tation which is repeated in different words below (ii. 5). For the
former, that the undoubted references to the Sermon on the Mount

1 They are collected in Resch’s Ayrczpha. Leipzig. 1889. Resides this verse (on
which 116 compares Isa. xxii. 17—21 and Acta Philippi, p. 147 T.) 116 includes i. 17
πᾶσα δόσις ἀγαθή, iv. 5 πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ, iv. 17 εἰδότι οὖν καλὸν ποιεῖν, v. 20
καλύψει πλῆθος among the number of sayings of Jesus unreported in our Gospels.
I have long held that we have in 11115 verse an ‘ unwritten w0rd‚’ but I do not think
there is much force in the arguments addueed by Rosch as regards the other verses.
