ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxlvii

which at the outside means that, though the Epistle was in general
circulation under that name, yet he did not take upon himself to
assert its authenticity; (3) in Rufinus' Latin translation of Origen’s
writings we find our Epistle referred to as follows: Gomon. ἄν. op. cad
Rom. iv. 1, in alio Scriptura& loeo, ib. iv. 8 condi et ,Iacobum fratrem
Domini, ib. iX. 24 <Iacobus Apostolus dicit, and frequently 3 cf. Hom.
’ίη Ex. iii. 3, viii, 4, Leo. ii. 4, where it is also called Scriptura
divione,- (4) these expressions of the Latin, which some have without
ground suspected, are borne out by similar expressions in the
original Greek, thus in Sel. in Psalms. xxxi. 5 (Lomm. xii. p. 129)
the Epistle (ὡς παρὰ Ἰακώβῳ) is referred to as ἡ «γραφή, and it is
quoted as authoritative in Sel. in Exod. xv. 25, Oomm. in Jolc. XX.
10 and elsewhere (see above, pp. lxiv. solt), (5) in two distinct
passages Origen gives a list of the Sacred Books, and in both of
these the Epistle of St. J ames is included (Hom. in Gon. xxvi. 18,
Hom. in Jos. vii. 1 ; see Westcott, Canon, pp. 406 foll).

Ι next take the assertion that, if our Epistlc had been written 1⁴0 is not

true that the

before the Council of Jerusalem, it must have contained arguments pl nnnnnnnnn

of our

to prove that Jesus was the Messiah, such as those we find Epistleare

‘st t

ascribed to St. Peter in the Acts, and must also have dwelt more {flfififfleffly

upon the Second Coming. If the writer were addressing uncon-
verted Jews, as St. Peter does in Acts ii„ or were endeavouring to
recall Jews who were in danger of falling away, as the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews does, such arguments would no doubt
be in place; but as he is writing to believers, who accept Christ as
the Lord of Glory and future J udge (J ames ii. 1, v. 9), such argu-
ments would be out of place in a short letter, directed to the
special object of inculcating a practical morality on those who
were already believers. Nor can Ι see why we should expect
more to be said about the Second Coming. Is it not enough
that we are told ‘the Judge stands before the door,‘ and ‘he
that endureth temptation shall receive the crown of lise’?
Another point is that J ames has lost the old meaning of saith, and
makes it, not the foundation of the Christian life, but merely one
among a number of co-ordinate virtues. I do not deny that he
at times uses πίστις in the sense osa mere intellectual belief 3 but
when he describes the Christian religion as ‘ the saith of our Lord
J esus Christ' (ii. 1), when he makes saith the essential condition
of all prevailing prayer (i. 6, v. 15), when he ascribes the begin-
lt‘ 2

date.
