not only contradicts the brief contemporary notice of J osephus, but
is so full of high improbabilities that it must throw discredit on
the whole context. Still it is possible that 5311155 may have been

even more incredible that the Jews could have been in doubt as to
the belief of him who had been the most prominent member of the
Church at Jerusalem for twenty years or more, or could have
imagined that 0115 of such firm, unbending character, the very
opposite of a Cranmer, could be induced to deny his saith before

the people.
