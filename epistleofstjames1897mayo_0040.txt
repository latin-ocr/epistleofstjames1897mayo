xx INTRODUOTION

τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἀδελφὴ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, Μαρία
ἡ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ καὶ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνή (translated in the Peshitto,
‘His mother and his mother's sister, ancl Mary of Cleopha and
Mary Magdalene’). If we compare this verse with Mark xv. 40
and Matt. xxvii. 56, we find that, of the three women named as
present in addition to the mother of JeSUS, Mary Magdalene occurs
in all three lists3 ‘ Mary the mother of James and Joses' of the
two synoptic Gospels is generally identified with ‘Mary of Olopas'3
and we then have left in Matthew ‘the mother of the sons of
Zebedee,' in Mai-k ‘ 80101110,Ί and in John ¹ his mother's sister.’
Salome is generally identified with ‘ the mother of the sons of
Zebedee,' and there seems good reason also for identifying her with
‘his mother's sister' in the Fourth Gospel. It does not seem likely
that St. John would omit the name of his own mother3 and the
indirect way in which he describes her is very similar to the way
in which he refers to himself as ‘ the disciple whom J esus loved.'
If we are right in this supposition, it is natural that the two
sisters should be paired together, and then the two other Maries,
just as we have the Apostles arranged in pairs without a connecting
particle in Matt. x. 3, 4. If the sons of Zebedee were 50 nearly
related to our Lord, it helps us to understand Salome’s request that
they might sit on His right hand and 011 His left hand in His
glory, as well as the commendation by our Lord of his mother to
0110, who was not only his best-loved disciple, but her own nephew.
If, however, this interpretation is correct, if the sister of the Lord's
mother is not the mother of James and J oses, but the mother of
the sons of Zebedee, then the foundation-stone of the Hieronymian
theory is removed, and the whole fabric topples to the ground.
{here ⁸²²⁰ (5) Ι take next two minor identifications, that of ‘James the
‘metientia‘ less' with the ‘ brother of the Lord,' and that of Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου,

offlfffievsvitgllf of Luke vi. 16 and Acts i. 13, with J ude the writer of the Epistle,

Jffihtgrfflffi who calls himself ‘brother of James.’ We have seen that Mary

013105'1215825 the mother of James τοῦ μικροῦ and of J oses, in Mark xv, 40, is

wriivt‘i'lffotffighe probably the same as Mary of Clopas‚ and that we have 110 reason ,

61315ξέ8 of for inferring from the Gospels that she was related to J esus. If so,

u θ’ there is 011 end to the supposition that James the less is James

the brother of the Lord. But it is worth while to notice the
mistranslation in which Jerome imagined that he found a further ¹

argument for the identification of our James with the son of 1
