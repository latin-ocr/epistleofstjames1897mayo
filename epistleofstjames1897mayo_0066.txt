have been shaken by the absence of any sign from heaven to
announce the inauguration of the temporal reign of the Messiah.
We can imagine also that he may have found a stumbling-block
in our Lord's severity towards the religious leaders of the time and
his tenderness shown to publicans and sinners, so unlike the
Psalmist's declaration ⁶ Ι will not know a wicked person,' ‘ I hate

them with a perfect hatred.'
This state of mind, while perhaps not incompatible with the, belief

’ in Christ's mission as a preacher of righteoumess, and a willingness

to accept him as the anointed King of the Jewish people, might
easily lead to an anxious solicitude as to his sanity, and the prudence
of the measures he took for extending the number of his adherents.
Yet underneath this anxiety there must have always been on the
part of the brothers an intense love and reverence for Jesm, a
suspicion that, after all, if it were only practicable, His course was
a nobler, simpler course than that which they themselves sug—

case with the friends of Jesus, when according to his word ‘the
corn of wheat had fallen into the ground and died,' and they could
look back on that life of pure sels-sacrifice, that high mysterious
perfection of which they had all along been dimly conscious‚ and
remember how its sorrows had been increased by the lack of
sympathy on the part of those who should have been the nearest
and the dearest. How natural that a brot-her standing beneath the ·
Cross, having heard of the words spoken at the Last Suppes, should
then at last have thrown in his lot with Jesus and resolved,
whether in despairing remorse or with some faint dawning of
believing hope, ‘I too will no more eat bread nor drink wine till
the kingdom of God shall come 1’ How natural also that one of
the earliest appearances of the Risen Lord should have been made
to his repentant brother, and that that brother should from. that

day forth have united himself to the company of the Apostles,
and been chosen by them to preside over the church in Jerusalem,
