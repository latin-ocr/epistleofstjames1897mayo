162 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἤτω.] The only examples cited of this form are 1 Cor. xvi. 22 ἤτω
ἀνάθεμα, Psa. civ. 31, 1 Maec. x. 31 Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἤτω ἁγία, Aretaeus
i. 2. 79, Hippoor. 8. 340 L.‚ Olem. Al. Sto-om. i. 7. p. 339 P. ἤτω τις
πιστὸς, ἤτω δυνατός τις γνῶσιν ἐξειπεῖν, ἤτω σοφὸς ἐν διακρίσει λόγων, ἤτω
γοργὸς ἐν ἔργοις, quoted from Clem. Rom. 48 with the omission of a final
clause ἤτω ἆγνόςῑ 111 Strom. vi. 8. p. 778 the same quotation occurs with
ἔστω for ἤτω 111 the first two clauses. Hermas (Vis. iii. 3) has μόνον ἡ
καρδία πρὸς τὸν Θεὲν ἤτω, and it occurs in the treatise Ad Diogn. 12 ἤτω
σοι καρδία γνῶσις, ζωὴ δὲ λόγος ἀληθής, ancl 111 Epiphanius quoted below.
It was formerly read in Plato Bel). ii. 361 C, but Stallb. now reads
ἔστω, Zur. ἴτω. Sterrett Epv'qr. J. in As. Mi. has one instance (no. 31)·
εἰ δέ τις κακουργήσει, ἤτω ἔνοχος Ἡλίω Σελήνῃ, and Prof. W. M. Ramsay
(Ze. f. Vyl. Spraclforsclmmy 1887, p. 386) cites another from Tiberio-
polis in Phrygia κατηραμενος ἤτω αὐτὸς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ. He also
gives several examples of the Phi 17011111 form εἵτου. Dr. Ε. L. Hicks 111
0 private lette1 suggests that‘ it was 11 late form adopted through false
analogy fiom βῆθι βητω, στῆθι στήτω. The resemblance of ω βῶ στῶ,
ην εβην” εστην, ημεναι βημεναι might well lead to this)

τὸ ναὶ ναὶ καὶ τὸ οὓ οὕ.] ‘Let your yea be a yea and your nay a nay’
(and nothing more). Edersheim i. 583 quotes 0 Midrash to the effect
that ( the good man's yea is yea, and his nay nay.⁷ Ι prefer this, which
is the ordinary way of taking it, as the simplest and plainest, but
Schegg would tlanslate it as a direct quotation from Matt. v 37 ‘let
yours 110 the“ yea yea’ '‚and the“ nay nay) ' Justin M. while quoting
from St. Matt. inserts the article with St„ James (Apol. 1. 16 D) and so
Clem. Al. Str. V. lOO quotes τὸ τοῦ Κυρίου ῥητόν, ἔστω ὗμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναὶ καὶ
οὒ οὔ, ib. Vii. 67 δικαιοσύνης ἦν ἐπιτομὴ φάναι ’Ἑστω ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναὶ καὶ οὒ
οὔ,1111(1 Clem. Hom. xix. 2 τοῖς δὲ νομίζουσιν ὡς αἱ γραφαὶ διδάσκουσιν ὅτι
ὃ Θεὸς’ ομνύει ἔφη, ἔστω υμῶι τὸ ναι ναὶ καὶ τὸ oi) ού. So also Epiphanius
Haer. i. p. 44 τοῦ Κυρίου λεχοι τος Moy ὀμνύναι μητε τὸν οὗρανὸι μήτε την
γῆν μητε ἕτερόν τινα ὅρκον, ἀλλ’ ἤτω ’ἱμῶν τὸ ναι ιαι καὶ τὸ ου 011.ΒοοΟ11
(Zeitsclzr. f. kvrchl. stensclzafl u. k. seben 1888, 1111. 283- 288) regalds
this variety as a proof that we have' 111 them different renderings of the
same Aramaic loqion. Similarly he regards the ὅλως of Matt. and the
πρὸ πάντων of J ames as standing for the same word in the original, ·
and 00111110100 τὸ ναί with ὁ Ἀμήν 111 Α1100.111.14. If Stanley and
Alf01d 010 rioht m their explanation of ⁰ Cei. i. 17 (ἢ α βουλεύομαι κατὰ
σάρκα βουλεύομαι, ινα ᾐ παρ’ ἐμοὶ τὸ ναὶ ναί, καὶ τὸ oi) οὕ ‚·) it 1100 110 10101-
01100 to 0111 L01d’ 0 WO1ds‚and 10 indeed used in 011 opposite sense,
implying either blainable inconsistency or, as others think, over-con-
fidence and obstinacy.

ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε] = ἵνα μὴ κρίθητε above V. 9: cf. Sir. xxix.
19 ἁμαρτωλὸς ἐμπεσεῖται εἷς κρίσεις. The judgment would be for the
breaoh of the third commandment.

13. κακοπαθεῖ τις] 800 011 κακοπαθία above V. 10. The verb occurs
in N.T. only here and in the Second Epistle to Timothy ii. 3 κακοπάθησον
ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης, Ver. 9 κακοπαθῶ μέχρι δεσμῶν, ib. iV. 5 νῆφε καὶ κακο-
πάθησον. For examples of a hypothesis contained in an indicative
clause without any hypothetical particle, see above iii. 13 n., 1 Cor. vii.
