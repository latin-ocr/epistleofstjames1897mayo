ccxx INTRODUOTION

words is concerned, St. James is more idiomatic than the other
canonical writers, and for the rest that he uses with freedom rare
words and componnds, all of them correctly formed and some of
them possibly formed by himself. He is however a purist in
regard to those combinations of prepositions and adverbs which are
so marked a feature of late Greek, eg. ὑπερλίαν 2 Cor. xi. 5, ἐφάπαξ
Heb. vii. 27, ἐκπάλαι 2 Pet. ii. 3, ἀπὸ τότε Matt. iv. 17, ἀπὸ πέρυσι
2 Cor. viii. 10, cf. VViner, p. 525.

Another point deserving notice in St. James, which might seem
to denote limited acquaintance with the language, is his use of
general instead of special ternis; though, as regards ποιεῖν and
διδόναι, Vorst (Helm pp. 158—163, 167, 59> considers that this
extended use is derived from the corresponding Hebrew words.

π ο ι ε ῖ ν. ἐ’λεος 11. 13, εἰρήνην 111. 18, ἁμαρτίαν V. 15, συκῆ ἐλαίας
οὐ ποιεῖ 111. 12, ἁλυκὸν οὐ δύναται γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ 111. 12,
ποιήσομεν ἐκεῖ ἐνιαυτόν iv. 13, ποιεῖν καλόν iv. 17, π. καλῶς 11. 8, 19,
cf. ποιητὴς λόγου 1. 22 ποιητὴς νόμου iv. 11, ποιητὴς ἔργου i. 25.

ἐρ γ ά ζε σ θ α ι. ἁμαρτίαν 11. 9, δικαιοσύνην 1. 20, τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν
τῆς πίστεως κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν 1. 3.

λ αμβ ά ν ε ι ν. τι παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου 1. 7, τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς
1. 12, κρίμα λήμψεσθε 111. 1, αἰτεῖτε καὶ οὐ λαμβάνετε iv. 3, ἕως
ἂν (ὁ καρπὸς) λάβῃ πρόϊμον V. 7, ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τοὺς προφή-
τας V. 10.

ἔχ’ ε ι ν. ἡ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον τέλειον ἐχέτω i. 4, μὴ ἐν προσωπολημ-
ψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν 11. 1, πίστιν, ἔργα ἔχει τις 11. 14, 18, πίστις
ἔχει ἐ’ργα 11. 17 (cf. Clem. R. ii. 6, 9 ἔργα ἔχοντες), ζῆλον ἔχετε ἐν
τῇ καρδίᾳ 111. 14, ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ ε”χετε iv, 2.

δ ι δ ό ν α ι. ὁ οὐρανὸς ὑετὸν ἔδωκεν v. 18.

I go on now to speak of the style of the Episffle, as exhibited in
the writer's use of rhetorical figures and of rhythm. Though
we do not find here the oratorical power of the Epistle to the
Hebrews or the rapid and impassioned eloquence of St. Paul3
though there is no attempt to build up a number of sub-
ordinate clauses into elaborate periods3 yet there is something
too of rhetorical skilL and at times of idiomatic phraseology
which is very telling. The sentences are short, simple, direct,
conveying weighty thoughts in weighty words, and giving the
impression of a strong and serious individuality as well as of a
poetic imagination.
