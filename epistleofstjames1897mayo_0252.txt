CHAPTER X
DID ST. -JAMES WRITE IN GREEK 011 IN ARAMAIC?

IN the First Series of Studia Biblz‘ea, p. 144 foll„ Bishop John
Wordsworth adduces the following arguments to show that our
Epistle was probably written in Aramaic :1—(1') This was the
language usually spoken by our Lord. (2) It was used by St.
Paul in his address to the mob of Jerusalem. (3) We are told by
Papias that the Gospel of St. Matthew was originally written in
Hebrew (i.e. Aramaic) and interpreted by each as he was able.2
(4) Papias also states that St. Mark acted as interpreter to St.
Peter, and Glaucias, claimed by the Gnostics as the teacher of
Basilides, is named as another interpreter of the same Apostle.3
Jerome takes it for granted that the Epistles of St. Peter were
not originally written in Greek, and thinks that the difference
between them was due to the employment of different men as
interpreters.4 (5) Some of the Fathers supposed the Epistle to
the Hebrews to have been written in Hebrew.⁵ Josephus wrote
his book on the Wars of the Jews in ‘his national language ' and

1 According to Wold. Schmidt (Lelwyelmlc cl. Jalcobus-Brz'vfes‚ p. 10) the Aramaic
origin of the Epistle had been previously maintained by Faber (Obs. in epist. Jcoeobz'
ccc Syro, Coburg, 1770), Schmidt (Historiscla-Krz'tz'sche Einlcz‘tuny in N. 11, Giessen,
1818), Bertholdt (Einlcz'tzmgy, Erlangen, 1819). ο

was thettranslator of the Second Epistle, this might account for the doubt as to its
canonici y.
