ΟΝ THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES ccxi

τοὺς προφήταςε the subject·- precedes in ii. 5 ὁ Θεὸς ἐξελέξατο
τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους ἐν πίστει, and in i. 18
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς α’παρχήν. Sometimes an
adverbial phrase supplies the place of an oblique subject, as in
i. 2 χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε, which might
have been expressed by χ. ἠγ. πειρασμούς or τὸ πειρασμοῖς περι-
mcciv: sometimes of an oblique predicate, as in ii. 1 μὴ ἐν
προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν, which might have been
expressed μὴ προσωπολημπτοῦσαν ἕχ. τ. π.

(4) The verb usually precedes the case it governs unless the
speaker intends the substantive to be emphatic, as in ii. 14 τι
ὄφελος ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ, where λέγῃ τις
inter-vening between πίστιν and its verb gives additional force to
the former. In this Epistle the verb precedes in 88 cases and
follows in 32, omitting relative clauses,

(5) In· interrogative sentences the word which contains the
interrogation usually comes first, but is sometimes postponed for
emphasis, as in iv, 12 σὺ δὲ τίς εἶ; ii. 21 Ἀβραὰμ...οὐκ ἐξ ἔργα-υ
ἐδικαιώθη ; ver. 21 ἰΡαὰβ...οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ,·
