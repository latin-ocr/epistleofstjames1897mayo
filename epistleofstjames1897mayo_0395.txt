τὸ κενὸν, and my n. on Cic. N.D. II. 136 alvi natura. If we are 130
131ἀ11616.136113,113 is best] done by an adverb ‘every kind of animal is
naturally subJecb 130 man.’ Brute nature under all its forms is under
13116 60111310] of human nabure. 11, 16 also vaguer than πάντα τὰ θηρία
and may be supposed 130 admib of individual exceptions.

θηρίων τε καὶ πετεινῶν ἑρπετῶν τε καὶ ἐναλίων.] The classificabion resembles
than in Gen. i. 26, ix. 2 ὁ φόβος ὑμῶν ἕσται ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς,
ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ κινούμενα ἐπὶ τῆς ’γῆς καὶ
ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἰχθύας τῆς θαλάσσης, Deub. iv. 17, 18, Acts X. 12 τὰ
τετράποδα τῆς γῆς καὶ τὰ ἑρπετὰ καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, 1 Kings iV. 33
(Solomon) ἐλάλησε περὶ τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν πετεινῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν
ἑρπετῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν ἰχθύων. So Philo Μ. 2. p. 352 foll. divides ζῶα
111ῢο τετράποδα, ἔνυδρα, ἑρπετὰ, πτηνά, The word θηρία has a wider 01‘
narrower meaning: 11) may even include bees, fishes‚ and worms (see
exx. in lex.)‚ or may be confined ‘co quadrupeds or more sbrictly 130 wild
beasbs, which is of course the prominent idea here, as 1311616 16 110 need

ἑρπετά 16 used in a wider sense for animals Which walk 011 four or more
legs, in conbradisbinction 130 man who walks on two, as 111 Χ611. Illam. i.

including 13116 weasel, 13116 11101166, 'ohe lizard‚ 13116 grasshopper (LeV. xi.
21, 29). The word ἐνάλιος is 11013 found elsewhere in 'ohe Bible‚ but ib is
quite classical (cf. Soph. Ant. 345 πόντου τ’ εἰναλίαν φύσιν), and is used,
as here, with subsssantival force by Plut. Illor. 669 τὸ τῶν ἐναλίων γένος,
ib. 729, Cf. ps. Arist). Mund. 5 ἐναλίων ζώων καὶ πεζῶν καὶ ἀερίων φύσεις
ἐχώρισε. For the coupling of the words in bhe list by τε and καὶ com-
pare Rom. 1. 14 ’Έλλησί τε καὶ βαρβάροις, σοφοῖς τε καὶ ἀνοήτοις.
Probably beasbs and birds are coupled as 13116 nobler orders, and 13116
other two because some of 13116 ἑρπετὰ are amphibious, and 01311616, as
snakes, closely resemble some fishes.

all things 3 in classica] writers both liberally and metaphorically. For

p. 793 foll. Here of course emphasis is gained by 'che combination of
the present and pei-sech: 13116 arb of taming is no new bhirg, 111113 has
