ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxix

together for the Lord's Supper ; they go to law ono with another
in the courts of the heathen 3 their religious meetings are a scene
of confusion and disorder from each man’s eagerness to got a hear—
ing3 they are falling back into idolatry3 they even disputo tho
authority of their spiritual father and deny his apostleship. So
the Galatians within ten years of their conversion have departed
from the Gospel which Paul preached, and have to be stornly
warned against the works of the fiesh. Even in his earliest Epistle
written to the Thessalonians shortly after their conversion, he bids
them be at peace among themselves, admonish the disorderly‚ 611-
courage the faint-hearted, quench not the Spirit, despise not pro-
phesyings. The Epistles to the Seven Churches in the Apocalypse,
the first of St. John, the second of St. Peter, that of St. J ude and
that to the Hebrews‚ give an even less satisfactory picture of the
Christian Church than the Epistle of St. J ames does.

So far as St. Paul himself is concerned, his later Epistles‚ such as
those to the Philippians and Ephesians, describe a nearer approach
to a perfect state of things in the churches addressed than is to be
found in his earlier Epistles. And this, of course, is what we should
naturally expect. A chui‘ch just converted from J udaism or
heathenism will not at once lose the traces of its former condition.
The Pharisee, who loved the chief seat in the synagogue and to be
called of men Rabbi‚ will not on the moment of conversion lose his
liking for these things, any more than the Corinthian will at once
learn reverence and purity. Christian perfectiori is a plant of slow
growth. Ι have already alluded to the way in which the Jews of
the Diaspora would probably have received the Gospel. Some
would have been powerfully affected by hearing St. Peter preach
on the day of Pentecost ; others might have been baptized by a
passing evangelist. To judge of the probable effect, let us take a
similar case in the present day. Place before your mind the most
successful of modern missions to the heathen‚ or of revivals at horne.
Is any one so sanguine as to imagine that congregations thus founded
will be at once freed from the dangers of ambition and worldliness
for years to come? If there is such a person, let me recommend
to him a study of the life of Fox or Wesley, or of any honest ,
missionary journal.
