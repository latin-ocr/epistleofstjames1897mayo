νόμον ζῶσιν ἐλεύθεροι, Seneca Via. Beat. 15 in ‘rcyno moti sumus: Deo
pao-ere libertas est ,· cf. the Collect ‘ Whose service is perfect freedom.’
The law of liberty is 'called τέλειος, as the heavenly Tabernacle in Heb.
ix. 11, because it carries out, completes, realizes, the object and mean-
ing of the Mosaic law which it replaces (Matt. v. 17). From ii. 8 and
12 we learn something of the contents of St. James’ law of liberty, he
agrees with St. Paul (Gal. v. 1 and xiii. 14, Rom. xiii. 10> in identifying
it with the law of love. Possibly he may not have contrasted it so
⁴strongly as St. Paul and St. Peter with the bondage of the Mosaic law
(cf. Acts xv. 10, Rom. viii. 2 foll„ Gal. iv. 9 foll„ 21 fon), but his
view naturally leads on to theirs. Cf. Iren. iv, 39 τὰ ἀποστάντα τοῦ
πατρικοῦ φωτὸς καὶ παραβάντα τὸν θεσμὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας παρὰ τὴν αὐτῶν
ἀπέστησαν αἰτίαν, ib. iv, 34. 4 libertatis lex id est verbum Dei ab apostolis
annuntiatum, iv. 37. 1, iv. 13. 2. For the position of the article see

παραμείνας.] Contrasted with the previous ἀπελήλυθε, as παρακύψας
with κατενόησε. Cf. John viii. 31 ἐὰν μείνητε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ...γνώ-
σεσθε τὴν ἀλήθειαν κ.τ.λ., Luke ii. 19, 51, ib. viii. 15, Dent. xxvii. 26
ἐπικατάρατος πᾶς ἅνθρωπος ὃς οὐκ ἐμμένει ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λόγοις τοῦ νόμου
τούτου ποιῆσαι αὐτούς, Philo M. 1. p. 180 τό γε ἁψαμένους τῆς ἐπιστήμης
μὴ ἐπιμεῖναι ὅμοιόν ἐστι τῷ γεύσασθαι σιτίων, Diod. ii. 29 ὀλίγοι παραμέν-
ουσιν ἐν τῷ μαθήματι (he is contr asting the supeificial study and the
absence of fixed principles among the Greeks with the opposite among
the Chaldeans) The parable, as Oecumenius iemaiks, is incomplete,
omitting to give the case of one who makes full use of the mirror, or
rather blending the figure with the interpretation in the word παρακύψας.
ἀκροατὴς {vaano-novas] For the gen. of quality see below 11. 4 κριταὶ
διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν, 111. 6 ὃ κόσμος της ἀδικίας (where see Imm), alSO
Essay on Grammar, and Win er, p. 297. The only other passage in which
ἐπιλ. occuis in all Greek lite1 atuie is Sit. xi 25 κάκωσις ὥρας ἐπιλησμονὴν
ποιεῖ τρυφῆς. Accoiding to Meineke' 5 coriection of a scholium to
Aristophanes (Fr. Com. ii. p. 223) the form was also used by Cratinus.
The usual form is ἐπιλῃσμοσύνη. Other exainples of such double forms
will be found in Class. Rev. ii. 243.
ποιητὴς gmon] This does not correspond exactly to the preceding
phrase, as the genitive here is objective. A more exact opposite would
have been π. φιλεργίας or ἐπιμελείας. Τ116 plesent phrase suggests such
an opposite as ἀκροατὴς φωνῆς. It acquires howevei a qualitative force
by dwelling upon and intensifying the meaning of the word ποιητής.
We have above π. λόγου v. 22 and below π. νόμου iv. 11.
