180 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

‘curn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever,' the punish-
ment] of ‘the wicked and slothful servant ' Mati. xxv. 26, Si. Paul’s
words in 1 Cor. ix. 16 ‘ woe is me if Ι preach nob 13116 Gospel‚’ 1 Tim.
iv. 16 ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ· τοῦτο γὰρ ποιῶν καὶ σεαυτὸν
σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου, 1 Cor. iii. 14, 15, Pirke Aboth v.
26, 27, ‘ whosoever makes the many righteOUS, sin prevails not
over him, and whosoever makes 13116 many to sin, they granb him
noh the faculty to repenbss Olem. Al. Str. vii. p. 863 ὁ γνωστικὸς, ἰδίαν
σωτηρίαν ἡγούμενος τὴν τῶν πέλας ὠφέλειαν, ἄγαλμα ἔμψυχον εἰκότως ἂν
τοῦ Κυρίου λέγοιτο, Consi). Ap. ii. 18 τοὺς ὑπνώδεις καὶ παρειμένους
ἐπίστρεφε, ὑποστήριζε, παρακάλει, θεράπευε, ἐπιστάμενος ἡλίκον μισθὸν ἔχεις
ταῦτα ἐπιτελῶν, ὥσπερ οὖν καὶ κίνδυνον ἐὰν ἀμελήσῃς τούτων. Spitta cibes
Sohar p. 47, 17 great is the honour of him who moves a siok man 130
repent, ib. p. 92, 18 great: is ‘che reward of him who leads back sinners
to the way of the Lord. It may on the other hand be urged thar it is
at any rate a lower monive than that proposed in Mati. xviii. 15 ἐὰν
ἁμαρτήσῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ὕπαγε ἔλεγξον αὐτὸν μεταξὺ σοῦ καὶ αὑτοῦ μόνου·
ἐάν σου ἀκούσῃ, ἐκέρδησας τὸν ἀδελφόν σου, and that: such phrases as
πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν and. σώσει ψυχὴν ἐκ θανάτου naturally remind us of the
preceding ἁμαρτωλός, and of the ἁμαρτία which brings forth deabh in
i. 15, but are unsuitable if used of one whom St. J ames would be likely bo
commission to call obhers 130 repentance 3 ef. Luke xxii. 32 σύ ποτε ἐπι-
στρέψας στήρισον τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου, Psa. 1. 16, li. 13, Maiae. XV. 14 ι on
13116 other hand the psalmista who had ‘ preaehed righ‘ceousness in the
great congregation' speaks of his iniquities as more numerous ‘ohan
13116 hairs of his head (Psa. xl. 9, 12).l

113 should be remembered however bhab a proverbial phrase is osten
used with a cerbain looseness‚ and that it is possible 130 make πλῆθος
cover 13116 sins of both parties, as Bede does: qui peccatorem ab errrore
convertit, el ejus peccata per lianc conversionem ab (aspectu judicis ab-
scondit, et sua quoque iu quibuscunque offendit errata ab intuitu ejus qui
onmia videt prozimum curando conteqit ,⁴ similarly Bengel and Sehnecken-
burger. Cf. Clem. Rom. ii. 19 (I exhorb you to give heed bo 13116
things bhab are wribten) ἵνα καὶ ἑαυτοὺς σώσητε καὶ τὸν ἀναγινώσκοντα ἐν

¹ Hammond, Hofmann and Schegg following Erasmus and the R.C. commentators
generally understand the sins covered to 116 those of the preaeher of righteousness ;
most modern commentators take them to be the sins of the person oonverted.
Calvin's note deserves to be quoted: Cibum dare esui-iculi et sitienti polum videmus
quanti Christus aestimet: atqui multo preliosior cst illi aiiimaa salus qaam corporis
vita. Cavondmn erqo ne nostra {quarm pereant redemptae a Christo animae, quarum
salutem quodam modo in manu nostra ponit Deus. Non quod salutem conferamus
ipsi ; sed quod Deus ministerio nostro liberat ac servat, quod alioqui videbatur exitio
propinquum . . . Alludil potius ad dictum Salomonis quam pro testimonio citat
. . . Qui oderunt, libidine 8636 volatico infamandi ardent: qui amant, libenter inter
36 condonant multa .· caritas erqo peccata sepelit apud homines. Jacobus hic allius
quiddam docet, nempe quod deleantur coram Deo, ac si diceret, Salomon huuc caritatis
fructum praedicat, qaod teqal peccata : alqui nulla melior teqeudi ratio, quam ubi iu
lotum coram Deo abolentur. Spitta explains the passage from the J ewish idea that
all a man’s sins were registered 111 heaven, but that the record might be partially or

entirely cancelled by the subsequent performance of good deeds, such as the convei-
sion of a. sinner.
