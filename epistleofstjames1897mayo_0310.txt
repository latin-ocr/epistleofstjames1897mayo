30 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

kingdom3 and in Matt. xix. 28 it is said that the twelve apostles
shall hereafter ‘sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of
Israel': comp. also Rev. vii. 4 foll. The prophets looked forward to
the reunion of lsrael and Judah (Isa. xi. 12, 13, J erem. iii. 18), and
under Hezekiah and Josiah many of the remnant of the Ten Tribes
came up to worship at Jerusalem (2 Chr. xxiX. 24, xxx. 1, xxxiv. 9).
So twelve goats were offered as a sin—offering for the twelve tribes at
the dedication of the second Temple (Ezra vi. 17, 1 Esdras vii. S,
Spitta compares Sibyll. ii. 170 ἡνίκα δωδεκάφυλος ἀπ’ ἀντολίης λαὸς ἥξει).
There would be no reason for keeping up the old feud between
the tribes in the captivity; and while it is probable that some of
those who were carried away by Shalmanezer may have adopted the
manners and religion of the neighbouring heathen, many would no
doubt attach themselves to the later captives from J udah, and either
return with the minority of these to J udaea, or continue to live in
Assyria with the majority. The book Tobit professes to give the
story of a religious captive of the tribe of N aphtali ‚- and Anna (Luke
ii. 36) is an instance of a resident in Judah belonging to the tribe of
Asher. 866 D. qs B. under Ca2215ivz'tz’eS. This form of address is one
among many indications of an early date for the epistle, the Christian
Jews not being yet definitely marked off from their unbelieving
countrymen. [Hermes (Sim. ix. 17) however includes all the nations
under heaven in his Twelve Tribes. O.T.]

ἑν τῇ διασπορᾷ] 866 Introduction on the readers to whom the
epistle is addl‘essed‚ and cf. 1 Pet. i. 1 ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς
Πόντου, Γαλατίας, Καππαδοκίας, Ἀσίας καὶ Βιθυνίας (if St. James, 33 is
probable, is here addressing the Jews of the eastern dispersion, this
may have suggested to 81. Peter his letter to the western dispersion)‚
John Vii. 35 εἷς τὴν διασπορὰν τῶν Ἑλλήνων, Deus». xxviii. 25 ἔσῃ δια-
σπορὰ ἐν πάσαις βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς, ib. XXX. 4, Ps. cxlvii. 2 τὰς διασπορὰς
τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπισυνάξει, 133. xlix. 6, Jer. XV. 7, Ν611. i. 9, Tobit xiii. 3,
Judith V. 19 ἐπιστρέψαντες ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν ἀνέβησαν ἐκ τῆς διασπορᾶς

>ii—spem] χαῖρε 13 1116 regular form of Greek salutation‚ as in Luke i.
28, 2 John 103 like salve in Latin. In letters it takes the forn]
χαίρειν (λέγει), like salutem (dicit). Horace (Ep. i. 8. 1 and 15) 11363 the
more literal translation {laudere et bene rem ywere (χαίρειν καὶ εῧ πράτ-
τειν). It is said to have been first used by Cleon in sending news of the
capture of Pylos (Luc. Laps. inter Salus. 3, suidas sxa). Aristophanes
in his latest play speaks of it as already old-fashioned, Plut. 322
χαίρειν μὲν ὑμᾶς ἐστιν, ἄνδρες δημόται, ἀρχαῖον ἤδη προσαγορεύειν καὶ σαπρόν·
ἀσπάζομαι δ’. Plato 13 said to have preferred the phrase εἶν πράττειν in
writing to his intimates (Pl. Ep. 3, p. 315). The Pythagoreans used
ὑγιαίνειν (see Menage on Diog. L. iii. 61). In the N.T. the epistolary
χαίρειν 13 only found here and in Acts xxiii. 26 (the letter of Lysias
to Felix) and xv. 23 (1116 letter, probably drawn up by 81. James,
from the Church at Jerusalem to the brethren in Antioch, Syria and
Cilicia). It occurs also in the letters of Alexander and Demetrius
