ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxliii

about the same time as the Gospel of Matthew <that is, towards the middle of
the 2nd century), the epistle of J ames and the Didache‚ which last Pfleiderer
considers to be later than Hermas and possibly later than Clemens Alexandri-
nus. This Catholicized Paulinism is characterized by a 111-11011001 undogmatic
tone, reminding one of the Synoptic Gospels.

This brief sketch of Pfleiderer's view of the general development
of Christianity was needed in order to enable the reader to appre-
ciate 1113 remarks on James in particular (pp. 865-sso).

Pfieidcrer agrees with Schwcglcr that our cpistle is just the Shcpherd strippcd Hemnsiders

of its Apocalyptical imagcry. In both writings we have a protest 011 11011011 of ibat the
the practical piety of the common people against the increasing secularization 0ῗὶζῖῒὲῗέῼί
of religion in the wealthy and intellectual 0110103, which we may comparo wasacm..
with similar protests made by the VValdensians or Minorites in later 1111103, regium-ary&
Our 01113110 must evidently belong to the pust-Pauline period3 otherwise it Iisdiiidddim
must have contained some reference to the controversial topics of which st. ‘'1‘0111111111-
Paul treats, such as the abrogation of the Mosaic law, 0110111110131011,
30111101113 and festivals, the position of Israel as the chosen people, the
relation of the Old to the N ew Covenant, &c The question then arises, How
long after the death of St. Paul must it be placed? We are enabled to answer
this partly from the lateness of patristic evidence as to the existence of the
epistle, and partly from its dependence on other Christian writings. (1) As
to the former our epistle is 111 0 worse position than any other of the books
of the N. T. Origen is the first to quote it directly, and he expressly
says that it was not generally recognized as canonical. There is no refer-
ence to it in Clemens Alexandrinus or Irenaeus or Tertullian, not even in
the Clementines. Moreover it is omitted in the Muratorian canon, which
recognizes the Shepherd. This silence of the oldest witnesses 13 inexplicable
if it belonged to the Apostolic age. (2) The writer was acquainted with the
epistles to the Romans and Galatiam, as is apparent from his 1130 of the
Pauline formula of ‘justification by faith' ; also with the epistle to the
Hebrews, the Apocalypse (including the most recent portion of the latter,
which dates from the time of Hadrian), the lst epistle of Peter, above
all with Hermas, whom Pfleiderer regards as the older writer, because the
aphorisms of St. J ames are there found embedded in a suitable context. In
any case the two writings were composed under similar circumstances and
without doubt nearly at the same time. These facts prove that the address to
the Twelve Tribes of the Diaspora is not to be understood literally. If there
were then any pure J ewish churches it could only have been in J udea, which
is excluded by the term Diaspora. Besides what reason could there be for confin-
ing the exhortation of the epistle to the J ewish Christians? It was not 'they
but the Gentiles who were in danger of trusting in saith without works. We
must therefore understand the phrase in reference to the true Israel scattered
throughout the world. It is a mistake to lay any stress on the term ‘syna-
gogue,’ which is freely used of Christian churches by Hermas and Ignatius.

The aim of the writer is a restoration of a retiring unworldly Christianity
of self-renunciation and brotherly kindness : what he especially attacks is the
worldliness of the upper classes. His condemnation of a wisdom which he
characterizes as earthly‚ psychical, devilish, reminds us of the words in which
Hermas describes the Gnostic teachers and prophets who were to be found at
Rome in the middle of the second century, and must probably be understood
of these. J ude, too, speaks of the Gnostics as ψυχικοί, and charges them with
complaining of destiny (v, 16 μεμψίμοιροι), which we may compare with
,1011103 1. Χ13, where we read of some who complain of God as tempting them to
