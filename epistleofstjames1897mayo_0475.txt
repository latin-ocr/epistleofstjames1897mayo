death, and combined with the thought of our being joined with Christ
in His crucifixion and resurrection. Thus we read (l 5011. iii. 14) ‘we
know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the
brethren,' Eph. ii. 4-(3 ‘God, for his great love wherewith he loved
us, even when we were dead in sins, quickened us together with Christ,
and raised us up together and made 113 sit together in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus,’ Col. ii. 12, 13, iii. 1, Rom. vi. 3—11.

(5) At other times it is described as a change from darkness to
light, as in Eph. V. 8 ‘ye were once darkness, but now are ye light in
the Lord,' Col. i. 13, 1 Pet. ii. 9, 1 Joh. ii. S-ll.

(6) Or from slavery to freedom, as in Rom. vi. 22 ‘but now being
made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit
unto holiness, and the end everlasting life‚’ Rom. viii. 2 ⁶ the law of the
Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and
death,’ 5011. viii. 32, James i. 25.

(7) Or it is described more simply as conversion or turning, see
Matt. xviii. 3 ‘except ye be converted (ἐὰν μὴ στραφῆτε) and become
as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,'
J as. v. 19.

description of this change 13 the receiving of the Holy Spu-it, through
whom Christ dwells in 113 and we 111 Η1111, 366 Rom. viii. already

The idea of regeneration was connected by the Jews with their rite
of circumcision and also with the admission of proselytes by the
ceremony of baptism.l It was therefore only natural that when
baptism became the sacrament of admission into the Church of Christ
it should be regarded as possessingla regenerative power. St. Peter,
comparing it with the preservation of Noah in the ark, says ‘the
η like figure whereunt0‚ even baptism, doth now save us ' (1 ep. iii. 21).
St. Paul speaks of our being saved by the washing of regeneration
and renewing of the Holy Ghost (Tit. iii. 5), and says that ‘as many
as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ ' (Gal. iii. 27), that ‘ ye
were buried with Christ in baptism, wherein also ye were raised with
him through saith in the power of God who raised him from the
dead⁷ (Col. ii. 12). 80 St. John Lo. ‘except a man be born of water
and the Spirit he cannot enter into the ,kingdom of God. The love
of system led later Chul-ch writers to limit the use of the term Re-
generation to the special grace conveyed in Baptism, carefully dis-
tinguishing it from Justificaffion, Conversion, Sanctification, and so on.‘3
In our Baptismal Service water is said to be sanctified to the mystical
washing away of sin, and the baptized child is said to be regenerate
