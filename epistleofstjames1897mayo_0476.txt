and grafted into the body of Christ⁷s Church. J. B. Mozley in his

treatise on Baptismal Regeneration argues that since regeneration,
strictly taken, implies Christian perfection, the assertion here made
must be understood hypothetically, as expressing a charitable hope
that the person is on the way to perfection. The more common
explanation is that all baptized persons are by the fact of their
baptism placed in a new state of spiritual capacity. It is important
to notice here two things: (1) that the same distinction is made
between outward and inward baptism as between outward and inward
circumcision. Of the latter St. Paul says, borrowing the figure used
in the book of Deuteronomy (xxx. 6), ί116 15 not a Jew which is one
outwardly 3 neither is that circumcision which is outward in the fiesh 3
but 116 15 6 Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the
heart, in the spirit and not in the letter'3 and so St. Peter after
saying that ‘baptism saves us,’ adds the cantion not ‘the putting
away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
(συνειδήο-εως ἀγαθῆς ἐπερώτημα) ‘towards God'3 and St. John, who
reports the words ‘except a man be born of water and the Spirit,
116 cannot enter into the kingdom of God,' gives a test by which
we may ascertain who is thus born, in the words ‘every one that
doeth righteousness is born of him ⁷ (l ep. ii. 29), ‘whatsoever is born
of God doth not commit sin' (ib. iii. 9), ‘whatsoever is born of God
overcometh the world 3 and this 15 the victory that overcometh the
world, even our saith ⁷ (ib. v. 4). That baptism was not always a rege--
neration in this high sense is shown by such instances as that of Simon
Magus, who, after he had been baptized by Philip, and received the gifts
of the Spirit by the laying on of the hands of Peter, was declared by
the latter to ⁶ have neither part nor lot in the matter, but to be still in
the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquit-y.' (2) We have to remem-
ber that the Apostles wrote at a time when adult baptism was the rule,
and infant baptism the exception. Baptism was then, as it is now in
heathen or Mahometan countries, the confession of the faith of Christ
crucified, when it entailed shame, persecution, even death. It was of
such confession Christ himself said ‘whosoever shall confess me before
men, him will I confess also before my 1111111161ἱ which is in heaven’
(Matt. X. 32); and St. Paul, ‘with the heart man believeth unto
righteousness 3 and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation'
(Rom. X. 10), with which we may compare the words recorded in
Mark xvi. 16 ‘he that believeth and is baptized shall be sax-eds Faith
and repentance (or conversion) were the necessary preliminaries to
baptism 3 but baptism, being the outward sign and seal of the inward
change, being also the confession of Christ before men, and being
accompanied by further gifts of the Spirit, became the summary ex-
pression for the new birth which preceded it. It is evident that in
these respects infant baptism now is something very different from
adult baptism then. Yet these differences do not derogate from the
uses of Infant Baptism. We rightly regard the offering of the child
to God by the parents in baptism as the first step in the Christian life,
the acknowledgment on their part of their duty towards the child as a
