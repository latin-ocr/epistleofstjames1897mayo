TO WHOM THE EPISTLE IS ADDRESSED cxlx

116 6150 takes occasion to warn them against another and no less
dangerous error, that an orthodox profession of faith, 1111666061-
panied by the fruits of good living, could suffice for salvation.
While the former error forms the subject of the first four chapters
of the Galatians, the second is dealt with in the two later chapters.
It is not abstract saith which avails, but faith working by love:
those who fulfil the works of the flesh shall not inherit the kingdom
of God: whatever a man soweth that shall he reap (Gal. v. 14-—
⁶26). So he insists in his Epistle to the Romans that it is not the
hearer but the doer of the law that is justified (ii. 13); that it is
vain to profess a knowledge of God and claim to be a guide to the
blind, an instructor of the foohsh, unless we practise what we
preach (ii. 17—23). He warns his readers against laying the
blame of their own sins on God (ix. 10 foll.); he urges them to
patience in tribulation, to perseverance in prayer, to bless and
curse not, to condescend to things that are lowly, to give place to
wrath (xii. 12—19), not to judge others, since we shall all stand
at the judgment-seat of God, to follow after things which make for
peace, and things whereby we may edify one another (xiV. 3, 4,
10—13‚ 19); and to turn away from those which cause divisions
(xvi. 17). The parallels from 81. J ames will be found in a previous
chapter (p. xciv foll).

It has been pointed out above that there is no allusion in this
Epistle to the controversy between the Judaizers and the upholders
of Gospel freedom, nay, that this controversy is so entirely ignored
that the writer is able to use the technical ternis of the contro—
versy with a totally different reference. In like manner other
controversies or topics which are handled elsewhere by his con-
temporaries are left unnoticed 'by him. There is no direct refer—
ence to the atoning sacrifice of Chris& none to the Sacraments3
none 10 ’1116 details of the Second Coming3 none to Church
organimtion, as in the Pastoral EpistleS. There is no allusion to
incipient gnosticism, as in the Epistle to the Colossians and those
to Timothy and Titus and in the writings of St. John. It is
assumed that those addressed accept Jesus as the Messiah, that
the new law of liberty has been written in their hearts by the
indwelling Spirit: but they are still ‘ zealous for the law‚' 65 81.
James describes them in the Acts3 they still seem to form one
bodywith their unbelieving compatriots ; still, as St. James says
again, ‘ hear Moses read to them every sabbath in the synagogues.’
