must explain it, either by supposing that the rich were more readily
indueed to apostatize and blaspheme Christ (cf. Acts xxvi. 11, Plin.
Ep. Χ. 97. 5, Polyc. sslccrt. 9) than the. poor, which may be illustrated
from Herm. Sim. viii. 6. 4 οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ ἀποστάται καὶ προδόται τῆς ἐκκλη-
σίας καὶ βλασφημήσαντες ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν τὸν Κύριον (called βλάσ-
φημοι εἷς τὸν Κύριον ib. ix. 19. 1) ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐπαισχυνθέντες τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου
τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, where see Harnack's note, or, in accordance with
Rom. ii. 24 τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν (a
quotation from Isa. lii. 5), 2 Pet. ii. 2 δι’ οὓς ἡ ὁδὸς τῆς ἀληθείας βλασ-
φημηθήσεται, 1 Tim. Vi. 1 ἵνα μὴ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ βλασφημῆται, Tit.
ii. 5, we may understand it of those who profess to know God but by
their works deny him, Tit. i. 16, cf. Clem. Rom. ii. 13. The use of the
active voice seems less suited to this interpretation, though Theile cites
from Euseb. [LE. V. 1 διὰ τῆς ἀναστροφῆς αὐτῶν βλασφημοῦντες τὴν ὁδόν.
On the whole I think the general sense of the passage suits better with
the idea that the blasphemers are unbelieving -Jews, as in Acts xiii. 45
ἀντέλεγον βλασφημοῦντες, and this iS suggested, as Dr. Plumlnel·
remarks, by the following ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, not ἐπ’ αὐτούς.

τὸ καλὸν ὅνομα.] Cf. below v. 14, Acts V. 41 ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος ἀτι-
μασθῆναι, Phil. ii. 9, 10 τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὄνομα, Acts iv. 12 οὔτε
ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν τὸ δεδομένον ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐν ᾧ δεῖ
σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς. Matt. i. 21, Dent. xxviii. 58 τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἔντιμον τὸ
θαυμαστὸν τοῦτο, Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σοῦ, 2 hlaec. Viii. 15 ἕνεκεν τῆς ἐπ’

ib. 58.

τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ {qs-Sta] This Hebraisni comes from the LXX. (Amos ix.
12) πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς, also quoted
by the writer of this epistle in his address to the Council at Jerusalem
(Acts XV. 17). The phrase is common in the O.T., see Deut. xxviii.
10 ὄψονται πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὅτι τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐπικέκληταί σοι, Numb. Vi.
27, 2 Chron. vii. 14, Isa. lxii. 2, lxiii. 19, Jer. xxv, 29, 2 BIacc. viii.
15. It is used not only of Israel, as the people of -Jehovah, but also of
the wife taking the husband’s name (Isa. iv, 1), of children named after
their father (Gen. xlviii. 16). It is questioned whether the reference
here is to the name Χριστιανός, which came into use at Antioch appa-
rently before St. Paul’s first missionary journey (Acts xi. ³26), and
which is found Acts xxvi. 28, 1 Pet. iv. 16 (see Lightfoot's [quatias
vol. i. pp. 400-404)3 or to baptism, cf. Acts ii. 38 βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος
ῧμῶν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ἱῖ). viii. 16, X. 48, Hermas ›S‘I'DL 9. 16

ἑλομένῳ ἃναγεννῆθηναι...τὸ τοῦ Πατρὸς τῶν ὅλων ὄνομα. The latter eX—
planation seems the better, both as more suited to the phrase, which
seems to imply an actual invocation of the name of Christ over each
individual believer3 and also because Christians were known to each
