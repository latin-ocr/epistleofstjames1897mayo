” ON THE STYLE oF sT. ‚JAMEs ccxxxi

which cometh from above. Still in its* rugged abruptness‚ in the
pregnant brevity of its phrases, in the austerity of its demand upon
the reader, in coneentrated irony and scorn, this Epistle stands alone
among the Epistles of the New Testament. Take for instance the
language used of those who place their reliance in the holding of
an orthodox creed, σὺ πιστεύεις ὅτι εἷς ἐστὶν ὁ Θεὸς· καλῶς ποιεῖς·
καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύουσιν καὶ φρίσσουσιν; compare this, not
with the writings of a weakling like Hermas, whom some have
ventured to name in the same breath with St. J ames, but with the
“writings of Stss Paul himself. 'The fiashes of irony, which break
through St. Paul's splendid vindication of his apostolic authority in
the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, seem passionless and pale,
contrasted with the volcanic energy which glows beneath the denun-
ciations of St. JameS. Or take the woes pronounced on the rich
in the fifth chapter of our Epistle: would it be possible to find
anywhere a nobler example—I will not say of Demosthenic‚ but
of Hebraic δεινότης, than where the rust of the unused coin is
first made to witness to the defrauding of the labourer, and then
avenges his ill usage by eating away the heart of his oppressor?
And what energy there is in the pathetic close, κατεδικάσατε
ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον· οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖνέ
