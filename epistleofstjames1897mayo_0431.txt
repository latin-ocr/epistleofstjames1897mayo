V 3, 4] NOTEs 151

ἰὸς σιδηρόν, οὕτως ὃ φθόνος τὴν ἔχουσαν αὐτὸν ψυχὴν ἐξαναψήχει, Basil. hom.
(le incid. p. 445 quoted by Suicer av. φθόνος, Sir. xxxiv, 1 ἀγρυπνία
πλούτου ἐκτήκει σάρκας. The pl. σάρκες is used for the fleshy parts of
the body both in classical and later writers, eg. Hom. ll. viii. 380 ῆ τις
καὶ Τρώων κορέει κύνας ἠδ’ οἰωνοὺς δημῷ καὶ σάρκεσσι, Aeseh. Cho. 280,
Theophil. Ant. i. 13 νόσῳ περιπεσὼν ἀπώλεσας τὰς σάρκας, and the
preceding quotations from the LXX. 3 while the sing. σάρξ is used for
the whole body. Cf. also Menander p. 198 M„ Antisth. ap. Laert. vi. 5.

ὡς πῦρ] 1 think the parallel passages lead ns to connect this with
what precedes rather than (as WH. and others after Cod. A. and
Pesh.) with what follows, cf. Isa. x. 16, 17, XXX. 27 ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ ὡς πῦρ
ἔδεται, ib. xxxiii. 11, Ezek. XV. 7 πῦρ αὐτοὺς καταφάγεται, Jer. V. 14, ΡΞ.
XXi. 9, Amos i. 12, 14, V. 6, vii. 4, Heb. X. 27 φοβεροί τις ἐκδοχὴ
κρίσεως καὶ πυρὸς ζῆλος ἐσθίειν μέλλοντος τοὺς ὑπεναντίους. It is not merely
gradual unperceived decay which is to be feared: this is changed
into gnawing pain and swift destruction as by lire in the approaching
judgment. Cf. J ude 7 πυρὸς αἰωνίου δίκην ὑπέχουσαι, Matt. XXV. 41,
Mark ix. 44 ὅπου ὁ σκώληξ αὐτῶν οὗ τελευτᾷ καὶ τὸ πῦρ οὐ σβέννυται.

ἐθησαυρίσατε] Absolute, as in Luke xii. 21 οὕτως ὁ θησαυρίζων ἑαυτῷ,
2 Cor. xii. 14. In Matt. vi. 19 we have the full phrase μὴ θησαυρίζετε
θησαυρούς, cf. Rom. ii. 5 θησαυρίζεις σεαυτῷ ὀργὴν ἐν ἡμέρα ὀργῆς, Prov.
i. 18 οἱ φόνου μετέχοντες θησαυρίζουσιν ἑαυτοῖς κακά, Amos 111. 10, Tobit
iv. 9, Psalm. Sol. iX. 9. ‘The aor. is used as 11 from the standing-
point 01 the day of judgment‚ looking back over this life,’ Alf. Perhaps
it is more correct to say that it refers back to the perfects σέσηπε,
κατίωται. The laying up 01 treasures is anterior to these. The word
ἐθησαυρίσατε is pregnant with irony: ‘Yon heap up treasure, but
the time for enjoying such treasure has come to an end, it is now
only a treasure of wrath in the day 01 wrath.' For the asyndeton
01. below v, 6.

ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις.] Cf. Acts ii. 17 ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις,
2 Tim. iii. 1 ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ἐνστήσονται καιροὶ χαλεποί, Didache 16. 3
ἐν τ. ἐσχ. ἡμέραις πληθυνθήσονται οῖ ψευδοπροφῆται. The singular ἐν τῇ
ἐσχάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ is often used in St. J ohn's Gospel; other forms are ἐν
καιρῷ ἐσχάτῳ 1 Pet. 1. 5, ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων τῶν χρόνων ib. V. 20, ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων
τῶν ἡμερῶν 2 Pet. 111. 3, ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου χρόνου Jude 18, cf. Deub. iV. 30,
Numb. xxiV. 14, Isa. xli. 23, 4 Esdr. xiii. 18, Vorst p. 109 foll„ WVest-
cott on 1 J oh. ii. 18 ἐσχάτη ὥρα. For the general sense see below on
ἡμέρα σφαγῆς, and for omission of article Essay on Grammar.

4. ἰδού] For the sing. see above on ἄγε iv. 13.

ὁ μισθὸς τῶν ἐργατῶν] Α reminiscence 01 the proverb ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης
τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ Luke x. 7, 1 Tim. v. 18. The word is used especially
01 husbandmen as in Matt. ix. 37.

τῶν ἀμησάντων] It does not seem that any distinction is to be drawn
between this and θερισάντων below. ἀμάω appears to mean originally
‘gathering,’ ‘heaping together‚' as of the ant ἴδρις σωρὸν ἀμᾶται Hes.
Opera ’ῖ 7 8 , 01 ‘pressing the curds ‘together' ἀμησάμενος Od. ix. 247,
01 preparing a couch εὐνὴν ἐπαμήσατο Od. v. 482 3 hence (in compounds)
of heaping up earth round the roots of a plant Xen. Oecon. xix. 11
