PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

In writiny my Prefaee I brings to a close a work which has for
some years been my chief oeeupation, and which has indeed been
seldom out of my thouyh ts since the time when, as an underyraduate‚
Ifirst made acquaintance with Coleridye’s Aids to Refiecbion‚ and
was led in consequence to study with some carc the Epistle of St.
James, to which reference is made in the earlier Aphorisms of that
book.

In the Introduction I hare stated my reasons sor believiny this
Epistle to be the earliest of the books of the New Testament, written
probably in the fifth decade of the Christian era by one who had
been brouyht up with Jesus from his childhood and whose teachiny
is in many points identieal with the actual words of our Lord as
recorded in the Synoptie Gospels. If I am not mistaleen‚ it presents
to us a picture of pre-Pauline Ohristianity, which is not only
interesting) historieally, but is likely to he of special value in an aye
of reliyious doubt and anociety like the present. Amonyst those
to whom the formulas of later Christianity have lost or are losiny
their siqnifieanee, there must be many who will find a messaye suited
to them in the lanyuaye of this, the least technical of all the Epistles‚
many who will appreciate the strony praetieal sense and earnest

philanthropy of St. James, and tahe to heart his warninys ayainst
