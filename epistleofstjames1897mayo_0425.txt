iv 1244] NOTEs 145

as opposed 130 the {senerah Erdmann and Beyschlag, reading καί above,
wrongly translate ‘ we will journey for two days) The dispersion of
the Jews, which gave them connexions all over the world and let them
know at once of any new opening for trade, led to their being con-
stantly on the move. Thus we read of Aquila and Priscilla at Rome
and at Corinth (Acts xviii. 1, 2), at Ephesus (ib. v. 18), again at Rome
(Rom. xvi. 3) and at Ephesus (2 Tim. iv. 19), see above i. 11 ἐν ταῖς
πορείαις. [See Zahn, I'Velcverlcelm· und Kirclae, Hanov. 1877. S.]

ποιήσομεν ἐκεῖ ἐνιαυτόν] Cf. Acts XX. 3 ποιήσας μῆνας Τρεῖς, ib. XV. 33,
xviii. 23, Prov. xiii. 23 δίκαιοι ποιήσουσιν ἐν πλούτῳ ἔτη πολλα. The
usage appears to be confined to later Greek, see Shilleto on Dem. RL.
p. 392, Vorst, p. 158 foll. There is a similar phrase in Latin, cf. Sen.
Ep. 66. 4 quamvis paucissimos una fecerimus dies, tamen multi nobis
sermones suerunt.

ἐμπορευσόμεθα] Elsewhere in N.T. only in 2 Pet. ii. 3, where it has
a transitive force. In LXX. (Gen. xxxiv. 10) and in profane authors
it is intransitive as here.

κερδήσομεν.] Veitch cites examples of this rare form from Anthol.
ix. 390, Fragm. Trag. p. 14 Wagner. The Attic is κερδανῶ, with Aor.
ἐκέρδανα, Ion. and late Atb. κερδήσομαι, Aor. ἐκέρδησα (the latter occurs
often in N.T.). R. and P. give ἀποκερδήσω as fut. of the compound.
The pass. fut. κερδηθήσομαι occurs in 1 Pet. iii. 2. Dr. Plummer calls
attention to the repeated καί separating ‘the different items of the
plan. which are rehearsed thus one by one with manifest satisfaction.'

14. οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τὸ τῆς αὕριον.] ‘ PeOple that know not
(= ‘whereas ye know not,' Lat. qui non intelliyatis) what belongs to
the morrow’ 3 or, reading τά with some MSS„ ‘the things of the
morrow.’ The phrase is in apposition with οῖ λέγοντες, as ἀνὴρ δίψυχος
with ὃ ἅνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος 111 1. 7, 8. For the neuter article cf. Matt. xxi.
21 τὸ τῆς συκῆς, 2 Pet. ii. 22 τὸ τῆς παροιμίας, Rom. Viii. 5 τὰ τῆς
σαρκὸς φρονοῦσιν, xiv. 19 τὰ τῆς εἰρήνης διώκομεν, 2 Cor. ii. 30. For
ellipse of ἡμέρας see Winer p. 738.1

ἀτμὶς γάρ ἐστε] Often used for smoke, as in ἀ. καμίνου Gen. xix. 28,
ἀ. καπνοῦ Acts ii. 17, ἀ. τ. θυμιάματος Ezek. viii. 11, elsewhere for steam
or breath, as in the words attributed to Moses in Olem. Rom. 17 (a
quotation, as Lightfoot suggests, from Eldad and Modad) τίς εἰμι ἐγώ ,-
...ἀτμὶς ἀπὸ κύθρας ⁴ steam from a kettle.' It is found in the versions of
Symmachus and Aquila, where the Eng. has ‘ vanity‚’ as in Ecol. 1. 2,

² WH. read here in their text οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τῆς αὔριον ποία ἣ ζωὴ ὑμῶν. ἀτμὶς
γάρ ἐστε πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη, agreeing with B except that the latter omits ἡ before
ζωή. This seems to me to give a harsh construction for the genitive, and also to
weaken the force of the passage. The folly of boasting as to the morrow is naturally
exposed by pointing to our ignorance of what will happen 011 the morrow, and this
is itself a consequence of the uncertainty of our life, appearing and disappearing like
a shifting mist. The omission of the first step confuses the expression. It was easy
for τό or τοί to be lost before τῆς, and then γάρ would be dropped in order to supply
some sort of construction. Again, the weight of evidence seems to me in favour of
retaining ἡ before πρός (which also facilitates the reading of Sin. ποία ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν ἡ
πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη). The difference in meaning made by the retention of the

article is that the tendency to appear and disappear is made a property of the vapour,
not a mere accidental circumstance.
