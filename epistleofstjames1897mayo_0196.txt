cl xxvi INTRODUCTION

ceding verse reminds one of the words ‘ God saw that it was good ’
(Gen. i.) ; (2) that there is a reference to the creation in two
parallel passages of the Apocrypha (Sir. xv, 11-20, Wisdom i. 13 f.‚
ii. 23 fi). He interprets λόγῳ ἀληθείας of the creative word, com-
paring Psalm xxxii. 6, ‘ By the word of the Lord were the heavens
mades Aseneth 12 σύ κύριε, εἶπας καὶ πάντα γεγόνασι, καὶ ὁ λόγος
ὁ σὸς ζωή ἐστιν πάντων σου τῶν κτισμάτων, and thinks that
ἀπαρχή refers ‘to man’s pre-eminence over the rest of the creation.
The answer to this is that the whole object of the passage is to
show the impossibility of temptation proceeding from God, because
He is all—good and of His own will infused into us new life by the
Gospel, in order that we might be the firstfruits of a regenerated
world. The meaning of λόγῳ ἀληθείας 15 proved from its constant
use in the New Τ estament, especially from Ephesians i. 13 ἀκού-
σαντες τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς σωτηρίας, and
the parallel in 1 Peter i. 23-25, where the phrase ἀναγεγεννημένοι
. . . διὰ λόγου ζῶντος θεοῦ 15 explained by the words τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα
κυρίου μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· τοῦτο δέ ἐστι τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν
εἰς ὑμᾶς. It is plain too from the 2151 and following verses, where
it is called ‘ the engrafted word which is able to save your souls,'
and where we are warned to be ‘ doers of 1116 word and not hearers
only.' Yet even here Spitta (θέσιν διαφυλάττων) sticks 10 11 that
'we are 10 think only of the creative word. How are we to do the
creative word‘.2 How is it 10 save our souls? How is it to be 10
us ‘the perfect law of liberty' of 17. 25 2 All these phrases have a
111511110111761)7 Christian meaning shown in the parallels I have cited
from St. Peter and St. Paul. To understand them in any other
sense makes nonsense of the whole passage. The word ἀπαρχή
also is mistranslated by Spitta. It denotes not a climax, but a
prophecy.

I will notice only one more passage out of many that I had
marked, viz. v. 14, 15 προσευξάσθωσαν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἀλείψαντες
ἐλαίῳ ε’ν τῶ ὀνόματι· καὶ ἡ εὐχὴ τῆς πίστεως σώσει τὸν κάμνοντα,
καὶ ἐγερεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος. Τ1115 simple regulation as 10 1116 1116111011
10 116 pursued in working a miracle of healing, seems 10 1116 1101
1655 strong a proof that the Epistle was written at a time when
such miracles were expected to 116 wrought, and were regarded as
customary incidents-a state of mind of which I do not think any
example is to be found either in the century preceding the preach—
ing of the Baptist, or in the post-apostolic age—I say, this is not
