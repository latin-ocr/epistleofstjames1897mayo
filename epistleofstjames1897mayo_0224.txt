cciv INTRODUCTION

Of action, as i. 14 πειράζεται ὑπὸ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἐξελκόμενος καὶ
δελεαζόμενος, V. 1 κλαύσατε ὀλολύζοντες, v. ’7 ἐκδέχεται τὸν καρ-
πὸν μακροθυμῶν, or by introducing some new consideration, which
may be causal, as i. 2 πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε γινώσκοντες κ.τ.λ.,
111. 1 μὴ γίνεσθε διδάσκαλοι εἰδότες κ.τ.λ.; or concessive, as iii.3
τὰ πλοῖα τηλικαῦτα ὄντα καὶ ὑπὸ ἀνέμων σκληρῶν ἐλαυνόμενα μετά-
γεται (‘ though so great ') ; or may describe the circumstances under
which the action takes place, as i. 13 μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος λεγέτω,
1. 26 εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν ἀλλ’
ἀπατῶν καρδίαν ; or the accompaniments, sometimes including the
consequence, as ii. 9 ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ
νόμον, 1. 22 μὴ γίνεσθε ἀκροαταὶ μόνον παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς
(‘ ye commit sin (md are convicted,' ‘ be not hearers only αηοῖ thus
deceive yourselves ').

Acrist expresses priority of time, eg. i. 12 δόκιμος γενόμενος
λήμψεται τὸν στέφανον (⁴ after being tried ²), 1. 15 ἡ ἐπιθυμία συλ-
λαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν, ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκυεῖ
θάνατον (‘ when it has conceived,' ‘ when it has come to maturity⁷);
when joined with an imperative the aorist denotes that the action
expressed by it must be done before the action expressed by the
imperative, eg. i. 21 ἀποθέμενοι ῥυπαρίαν δέξασθε τὸν λόγον (‘ lay
aside filthiness and receive the word ')‚ v. 14 προσευξάσθωσαν
ἀλείψαντες (‘let them anoint and pray'). The prior action may
be the cause of what follows, eg. i. 18 βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς.
It may also explain a preceding adverbial phrase, eg. ii. 21 ἐξ
ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαάκ, ii. 25 ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη ὑπο-
δεξαμένη τοὺς ἀγγέλους.

Peofect only found in the periphrastic subjunctive v. 15 ῃ
πεποιηκώς.

Fumone does not occur. Instead we have the periphrastic με’λ-
λων κρίνεσθαι 11. 12.

(b) With article.

Prcsmzt as attributive adjective i. 5 παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ
πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς, 1. 21, 11. 3, iii. 6, iv. 1, V. 13 as substantive iii. 4
ὅπου ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος βούλεται, v. 15 ἡ εὐχὴ σώσει τὸν κάμ-
νοντα, 1. 6, 12, 11. 3, 5, iii. 18, iv, 11, 12. Often the reference is
not confined to present time, but is equally applicable to past and
future, as in the examples quoted.
