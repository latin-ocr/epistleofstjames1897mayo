ΙΙ 18-19] NOTES 97

<epm-“la in the Olementine Homilies. This verse from Deuteronomy is
the commencement of the Shema‚ that portion of the law which was
appointed to be read or recited both morning and eveninfg· by every JeW.
‘For him who reads the Shema with scrupulous precision as regards its
several letters, they 0001 Gehinnom ’ <Bel-ahoth 156, quoted in Taylor,
Jewish Fatkers, p. 52, and exe. iv.). St. Paul depicts the reliance
placed by the Jews on their orthodoxy, Rom. 11. 17-22, Τ116 phrase

to me more impressive to regard it as stating· a simple matter of fact,
like σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις before. There is no need to suppose with WViner
(p. 678) that it expresses a condition, to which καλῶς ποιεῖς supplies the
apodosis3 what 13 Ρ1Η6Ρει16ᾶ for is the following phrase καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια
κ...,τλ not the merely parenthetic καλῶς ποιεῖς. Another question is
whether St. James must be supposed to speak here' m his own person, or
whether this verse also must be assigned to the interlocutor introduced
in v. 18. The repetition Of σὺ πιστεύεις aster σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις and the
decided break before v. 20 seem to favour the latter view, We must
suppose him thus to put forward the two arguments (1) belief without
works (may possibly be a real belief, but) can never prove its existence ;
(2) it may exist, and yet be consistent with diabolic malignity.

καλῶς ποιεῖς.] Τ116 phrase is not necessarily ironical, see above V. S
and Mark Xii. 32 καλῶς εἶπες ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν, bui] is made ironical by the
context, as 111 Μῑ·111ζ vii. 9 καλῶς ἀθετεῖτε την ἐντολήν, 2 (3012111. 4 εἰ ὁ
ἐρχόμενος ἄλλον Ἰησοῦν κηρύσσει. ,καλῶς ἀνέχεσθε, John iv. 17 καλῶς
εἶπας ὅτι ἄνδρα οὐκ ἔχω, lt· 13 often used 111 a colloquial sense by cl assical
writers, e. g. Demosth. p. 141, 14 μετὰ ταῦτα ἡ τύχη καλῶς ποιοῦσα (‘ many
thanks 13οῠ 1161· ’) πολλὰ πεποίηκε τὰ κοινά, id. Mid. p. 582 εἶσὶ μὲν εἰς τὰ
μάλιστα αὐτοὶ πλούσιοι καὶ καλῶς ποιοῦσι, where Relske translates id
vero laudo conyratulorque‚ id. Coron. p. 304, 26 (Philip’s cruelty others
have experienced) τῆς δὲ φιλανθρωπίας...ὗμεῖς καλῶς ποιοῦντες (‘ by good
luck ') τοὺς καρποὺς κεκόμισθε, Arist. Plut. 863 καλῶς τοίνυν ποιῶν
ἀπόλλυται (⁴ a good job ‘coo '): see Hermann' 3 Viger, p. 362. [Diod. v.
p. 442 R. καλῶς διεφθάρθαιζ a pretty clean sweep '.A]

τὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύουσιν. ] This is the term regularly used in the
Gospels for the evil spirits, also called πνεύματα ἀκάθαρτα or πονηρά, by
whom men are possessed and who aie themselves said to be subject to
Beelzebub. We have instances both of their belief and their terim 111

ηλθες ὧδε πρὸ καιροῦ βασανίσαιε ημᾶς; of their belief, Luke iv. 41 ‘ He

suffeied them not to speak because they knew he was the Chr’ist,
