THE AUTHOR xxv

out warning to the contrary, might naturally be expected to assume
that it did actually occur. How far this assumption on the part of the
reader, natural under ordinary circumstances, becomes unnatural un-
der the very extraordinary circumstances of the case, will be discussed
further on. Ι confine myself here to the argument from language.1

The natural inference drawn from the use of the word
πρωτότοκον in Luke ii. 7 is that other brothers or sisters
were born subsequently3 otherwise why should not the word μονο-
γενής have been used as in Tobit iii. 15 μονογενής εἰμι τῷ πατρί
μου, Luke vii. 12, viii. 42, &02 In Rom. viii. 29 the word is used
metaphorically, but retains its natural connotation‚ πρωτότοκον ἐν
πολλοῖς ἀδελφοῖς, and so in every instance of its occurrence in the
N.T. It occurs many times in its literal use in the LXX„ eg.
Gen. xxvii. 19, 32, xliii. 33, Deut. xxi. 15, 1 Kings xvi. 34, 1 Chron.
v. 1, xxvi. 10, but, so far as I have observed, never of an only son.
It is said in answer to this by Bp. Lightfoot (p. 271) that “the pro-
minent idea conveyed by the term first-born to a J ew would be not
the birth of other children, but the special consecration of this one.
The typica] reference in fact is foremost in the mind of St. Luke,
as he himself explains it, ‘Every male that openeth the womb shall
be called holy to the Lord' (ii. 23).’' But need we ascribe to St.
Luke any other purpose, in giving this quotation from the Mosaic
law, beyond the simple desire to explain how it was that Simeon
was enabled to see Him, who was not only ‘ the glory of his people
Israel,' but also ‘a light to lighten the Gentiles'2 No doubt the
law as to the first-born is equally valid whether there are other
children or not3 but St. Luke is not here concerned in stating the
law, but in giving a narrative of domest-ic life, viewed retrospectively
from the standpoint of accomplished facts: under these circum-
stances the use of the word πρωτότοκος is surely misleading, and
therefore improbable, if there were no children born afterwards.2

1 Laurent remarks ou ‘che use of the imperfect ἐγίνωσκε implying abstinence from
a habit (‘refrained from conjugal intercourse ⁷) as opposed to the far more usual ἔγνω
denoting a single act.

² Suicer, ii. p. 877, quotes from Severianus, πρωτότοκος λέγεται ὁ ἀδελφοὺς ἔχων,
and from Theodoret εἷ πρωτότοκος, πῶς μονογενής ,· the latter referring to a theological
difficulty arising out of Col. i. 15 (where see Lightfoot), but the phrase naturally
applies to the word taken in its simple meaning. In the Psalms of Solomon (xviii.
4) we have the two words combined so as to exclude the natural inference, ἡ παιδεία
σου ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ὡς {abu πρωτότοκον μονογενῆ. The latest editors suggest that these are
duplicate renderings of the same Hebrew word (p. lxxx.) I may mention here Dr.
Edersheim’s remark, that, if the Epiphanian theory were true, our Lord would not
have been the heir to David's throne according to the Genealogies‚ as his elder brother
would have ranked before Him. (Jesus the Messian, i. p. 364).

The use of

πρωτότοκος
in Luke ii. 7
implies that

J esus was
not the only
child of his

mother.
