THE AUTHOP xxxi

I will make one or two remarks on this passage and then con— c wo! »f
sider any further arguments advanced by later writeis on the same ism 1111111111
side. The exaltation of viiginity above mairiage‚ of which we see
traces in the New Testament itself, as in Apoc. xiv, 4, 1 Cor. vii. 1,
as well as among the Essenes and Therapeutae (Josephus HJ. ii.
8. 2, Philo Fray. M. 2 p. 633, Vit. C'ont. pp. 471 folh), and against
the exaggeration of which St. Paul warns Timothy (1 Ep. iv, 1),
spread rapidly both amongst heretics and orthodox Christians. Of
the former, Saturninus, Marcion, the Encratites and the Montanists
in the second century are named as either depreciating or actually
forbidding marriage among their adherents. Of the latter, evidence
may be found in Athenagoras Apol. 28 εὕροις δ’ ἂν ’πολλοὺς τῶν
παρ’ ἡμῖν καὶ ἄνδρας καὶ γυναῖκας καταγηράσκοντας ἀγάμους·
ἐλπίδι τοῦ μᾶλλον συνέσεσθαι τῷ Θεῷ; in such language as that
of Cyprian (Hah. Vir. 3) flos est ille ecelesiastici ymmonis . . . Dm·
imayo ‘respondens ad sanctimoniam Domini, illustrior portio gressis
Christi; ib. 22 quod futuri sumus, vos jam esse coepistis...czcm castae
perseveratis et virgines, amyclis Dei estis aequales3 and in the rash
act by which Origen‚ at the beginning of the third century, believed
himself to be carrying out the words of Christ (Matt. xix. 12). The
same tendency is also noticeable in the neo-Pythagoreans and neo-
Platonists. By the end of the third century it began to produce
its natural consequence in the institution of celibate communities
and the discouragement of marriage among the clergy. In the
Gouncil of Nicaea a determined attempt was made to compel
married clergy to separate from their wives, and the hermit Paph-
nutius, who led the opposition‚ only pleaded in favour of what he
calls the ancient custom, which, While it forbade marriage after a
man had been ordained‚ did not require him to leave the wife whom
he had married as a layman.1 We cannot doubt that those who
were agitat-ing for a stricter rule would make use of the example of
the Virgin, insisting on the name as implying a permanent state,
and would endeavour to give an artificial strength to their cause
*by the addition of imaginary circumstances to the simple narrative
*of the Gospel.
