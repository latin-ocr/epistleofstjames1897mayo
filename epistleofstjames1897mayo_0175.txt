HARNACK ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE clv

the genuineness of Seneca’s letters to Lucilius, of the De Arta
Poetiea of Horace, of the letters to Herodotus and Me11oeceus‚in
which Epicurus summed up his philosophy. But if all these are
allowed to be genuine, St. Paul was not the first person to make
use of the epistolary form for didactic purposes ; and if we further
accept the account given of the Apostolic Council1 in the Acts, he
was not even the first J ew to indite a circular letter 3 he was only
following the example already set by the President of the Council
in his circular to the Churches; as to which it has been already
pointed out that the resemblances between it and the Epistle <ff
St. J ames lead to the conclusion that they proceed from the same
hand.2 Julicher‚ however—I am not certain about Harnack—
would probably deny that the account of the Council given in the
Acts is historical. Let us assume then that St. Paul was the first
Jew to write a didactic letter for general circulation, why is his
example to remain unfruitful, not only till after his own death, but
till the death of the last of the Apostles, say thirty years later?
For this is what is required by his argument. Otherwise all the
Catholic Epistles might still have been written as early as 60 A.D. by
those whose names they bear.

I proceed now to consider the arguments offered in favour of the
date 120-150 favoured by J ulicher and Harnack. Both lay stress
on the low moral and religious tone implied by the language of the
writer. Worldliness had reached such a pitch as can only be
paralleled in the Shepherd of Hermas, with which indeed our
Epistle has so much in common that both must be ascribed to the
same age. Instances of this deplorable degeneracy are 1. 13, in
which the readers are warned against making God the Author of
temptation3 ii. 14, where orthodox belief is put forward as excusing
lukewarmness or sin; ii. 6, where it is stated that the rich members
of the Church drag their poorer brethren before the law courts
and blaspheme the Holy Name by which they are called, a picture
of the time which is in entire agreement with what we read in
Hermas (Sim, viii. 4, ix, 19, etc.) of the apostates and informers
within the Church (ἀποστάται καὶ βλάσφημοι εἰς τὸν κύριον καὶ
προδόται τῶν δούλων τοῦ θεοῦ). Such a state of things, implying
that Christianity was a crime punishable in the Roman courts, and

f Harnaek places the Council in the year 47, and considers that St. Paul's earliest
epissstllDe xixi'psfigplt written before 48-49.
