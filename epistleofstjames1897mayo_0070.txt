1 INTRODUOTION

of the three Epistles of St. John and the two of Peter is followed
by the words una sola, apparently a correction by an early
reader.1 On the other hand, the old Syriae version (Ρειεῖιὶιίῑο)2
contains all the books of our present Canon excepting the Apoca-
lypse, the second of Peter, and the second and third of John.
Origen (Hom. in J03. vii. 1> recognizes all our books, and the cata-
logue contained in the Catechism of Cyri} of Jerusalem (348 ΑΒ.)
includes all but the Apocalypse‚ with an urgent warning against
the useof any other books. With him agrees Gregory of Nazian-
zus writing about the same time, who ends his metrical catalogue
with the words πάσας ἔχεις. E? τις δὲ τούτων ἐκτός, οὐκ ἐν
νγνησιόις. Athanasius, in his 39th Festal Letter, dated 367 A.D.‚
gives precisely our present Canon, concluding with the words ἐν
τούτοις μόνοις τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας διδασκαλεῖον εὐαγγελίζεται. μηδ-
εὶς τούτοις ἐπιβαλλέτω, μηδὲ τούτων ἀφαιρείσθω τι. Amphilo-
chius, bishop of Iconium, speaks less confidently in a metrica]
catalogue (about 380 A.D.)‚ τινὲς δὲ φασὶ τὴν πρὸς Ἑβραίους νόθον,
ὀὐκ εὖ λέὙοντες· ’γνησία Γγὰρ ἠ χάρις. εἷεν. τί >tomi-6113 καθολικῶν

ἐνγκρίνουσιν, οἱ πλείους δέ Γγε νόθον λέγουσιν. Epiphanius, bishop
vof Salamis in CyprUS, who died about 403 A.D.‚ gives ‘ a canon of
the N.T. exactly coinciding with our own' (adv. Haeres. lxxvi. 5).
On the other hand we are told that our Epistle was rejected by
Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 4029).3

Towards the end of the fourth century Jerome (representing
the views of the Church of Rome) and Augustine (representing
the Church of Carthage) pronounced in favour of our present
Canon. The judgment of the former is given in the Vulgate
and in the catalogue contained in his epistle Ad Paulinum liii. 83
elsewhere speaking of James he says (Vir. Ill. 2) Jacobus qui
appellatur frater Domini...unam tantum scripsit epistulam, quae de

¹ C. H. Turner (Stud. Bibe. iii. 308) suggests that the original list contained onl)
1 John and 1 Peter, and that this was corrected by a later scribe, who appeuded the
note una sola implying that the MS. named only one Epistle in each case.

2 This has usually been ascribed to the beginning of the second century, but from
the absence of references to the Catholic Epistles in the Doctrina of Addaz' and the
Humilia of Aphraates it has been argued that these Epistles were not included in
the earliest Syrian Canon. See Stud. Bibl. iii. p. 245, class. Rev. iii. 456 foll.
