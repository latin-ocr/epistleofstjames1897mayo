resemblance is so great as to make it probable that one borrowed from
other, p. cxlv. The question of the genuineness of our Epistle must be
considered in connexion with that of the genuineness of the other books
of the N.T.‚ p. cxlix. Large demands on the credulity of their readers
made by the advanced critics, p. cl.

OHAPTER VII. PART ΙΙ
HARNACK AND srirrA ox THE DATE or THE EPISTLE

Harnack’s arguments for making the Epistle contemporary with the Shepherd
of Hermas, p. cliV. foll. ι it is a homily under the form of a letter, and
implies the previous existence of St. Paul’s epistles: the religious tone
cannot be paralleled before the time of Hermas : the view of the Law, of
F aith and Works, is incompatible with an early date. Inconclusiveness
of these arguments. The differences between our Epistle and the
Shepherd are such as can only be explained by the supposition of a long
interval of time. Harnack acknowledges that his view of the Epistle
leaves it a mass of inconsistencies, p. clxviii.

Spitta makes it a Hebrew document of the first century nc. and tries to show
that the passages in which the name of Christ occurs are interpolations,
and that parallels for what is thought to be Christian can be found in pre-
Christian writings. These arguments answered by a comparison with
other parts of the N.T. which do not show a more advanced Christology
than our Epistle, and by pointing out its 'unlikeness to J ewish writings,
such as the Psahns of Solonion and some treatises of Philo. Spitta’s
J ewish parallels tested, pp. clxviii-clxxviii.
