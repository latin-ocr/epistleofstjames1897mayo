Wgffgffs’ss certain opposition is implied, which is brought out more clearly
believers in St. Mark's narrative of the same event (iii. 21, 31—35).
From the latter it appears that the reason why they of his
family (οἱ παρ’ αὐτοῦ) desired 10 speak with him was because the
rumour which had reached them of his incessant labours led them
to believe that his mind was overstrained. As St. Mark goes on to
say (ver. 22) that the scribes accused Jesus of casting out devils
through Beelzebub, and as we further read in John (x. 20, viii.
48) that many said ‘ He hath a devil and is mad '3 it would seem,
though it is not expressly stated, that these calumnious reports of
1115 enemies had not been without effect on some members of
his own family. At all events, they went out prepared κρατεῖν
αὐτόν, τί. to put him under some restraint. This narrative gives
additional point 10 the words in Mark vi. 4, spoken with immediate
reference to the unbelief of the people of Nazareth, οὐκ ἔστιν
προφήτης ἄτιμος εἰ μὴ ἐν τῇ πατρίδι αὐτοῦ καὶ ὲν τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν
αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ. If it were simply the disbelief of
townspeople not immediately related to him, there seems no need
for the addition ‘in his own kinsfolk and in his own house.'
This inference, which we naturally draw from the words of St..
Mark, is confirmed by the express statement of St. John (vii. 3—5)‚
οὐδὲ «γὰρ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστευον εἰς αὐτόν, and by our Lord's
words addressed to them (ver. 7), οὐ δύναται ὁ κόσμος· μισεῖν
ὑμᾶς· ἐμὲ δὲ μισεῖ, ὅτι ἐνγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ αὐτοῦ ὅτι τὰ ἕρὙα
αὐτοῦ πονηρά ἐστιν. Compare this with the 1101015 spoken
shoitly afterwards to the disciples (xx. 19), εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου
ἦτε, ὁ κόσμος ἂν τὸ ι’διον ἐφίλει· ὅτι δὲ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου οὐκ ἕστε,
ἀλλ’ ἐνγὼ ἐξελεξα ὑμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου, διὰ τουτο μισεῖ ἱμᾶς ὁ
κόσμος. I defer the question as to the cause and nature of the
unbelief imputed to the Lord’s brothers, and the cause of their
subsequent conversion. I simply note here that in vii. 3 they are
represented as making a distinction between themselves and the
disciples‚ and that 111 vv, —7 they are said to be on the side of the
world against Christ. I think my readers will agree that the argu-
