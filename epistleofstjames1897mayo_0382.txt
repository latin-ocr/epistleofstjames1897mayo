102 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ὄντες, ἀγαπητοὶ δὲ φίλοις, Plabo Less. iV. 716 D ὃ μὲν σώφρων Θεῷ φίλος,
ὅμοιος γάρ, li’ep. x. 613 ‘ the righteous man is θεοφιλής and therefore all
must bui-n 01113 well with him’, Epion. Dies. iV. 3. 9 ἐλεύθερος γάρ εἶμι
καὶ φίλος τοῦ Θεοῦ, Cic. ΛΠ). I. 121, II. 165.

25. Ῥαὰβ ἡ πόρνη.] Selected as an example the furbhesl: removed
from Abraham: so Erasmus ‘tantum valet apud Deum misericordia ac
beneficentia in proximum, ιιι mulier, ιιι meretrz‘ae, ut alieniyena hospitali-
tatis officio commendata meo-uerit in catalogso piorum adnumerari.’
Probably 113 was on this account, thab her name was famous among the
Jews. She was counted as one of the four chief beaubies, 13119 obhers
being Sarah, Abigail, Esther 3 and was said 130 have been 13119 91109311933
of eighss prophets (Meuschen, p. 40), She is also cited as an example
of saith, Heb. xi. 31, and is menbioned in the genealogy in Matthew.
Her faibh is shown both by her actions here referred bo and her words
recorded in Josh. ii. 9, 11 ‘ I know 1311913 ‘ohe Lord God hath given you
the land...the Lord your God, He is God in heaven above and in earbh
bene-ath! 01911191113 of Rome (i. 12) connects 13119 two aspeots‚ to which
St. J ames and the writer of the episffle to the Hebrews direct] 91313911131011,
by his phrase διὰ πίστιν καὶ φιλοξενίαν ἐσώθη Ῥαάβ, 399 Lightfoot on 131113
passage and also his appendix (pp. 413 and 470) on 13119 attempt made
boffl1 by Jewish and Christian writers (Josephus, Chrysostom, &c.) to
weaken 13119 force of the word πόρνη.

ὑποδεξαμένη τοὺς ἀγγέλους.] Heb. xi. 31 δεξαμένη τοὺς κατασκόπους.
Βοὺ11 renderings are independent, of 13119 LXX. which says ἀπέστειλεν
Ἰησοῦς δύο νεανίσκους κατασκοπεῧσαι. The word ὑποδ- occurs elsewhere
in NT. only in 'che wri‘oings of St. Luke.

ἑτέρᾳ ὁδῷ] By a window instead of by the door, and to the mountain
instead of sbraighb back to the camp of ‘ohe Israelites, Josh. ii. 15, 16.
For this pregnant use of ἕτερος cf. Mai-k xvi. 12 ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ, Αο133 ii.
4 ἑτέραις γλώσσαις.

ἐκβαλοῦσα] In mild sense, as Mart. ix. 38 ὅπως ἐκβάλῃ ἐργάτας εἷς τὸν
θερισμὸν αὑτοῦ, Mark i. 12 τὸ πνεῦμα ἐκβάλλει αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον( = ἄγει
Luke‚ ἀνάγει Mam), John X. 4 ὅταν τὰ ἴδια (πρόβατα) πάντα ἐκβάλῃ
(= ἐξάγει, V. 3)-

26. τὸ σῶμα, χωρὶς πνεύματος νεκρόν ἐστιν] 11 seems ab first strange tha‘c
the outward visible part of man should be compared bo 13119 invisible prin-
ciple of saith, and the invisible spirit, be compared to works which are
13119 oubward fruibs of fai‘oh 3 bub we must always keep in mind 1311913 813.
J ames is speaking here nob of saith of the beart, bub of a mere lifeless
profession of orthodoxy, ⁴ professing 130 know God bui] in deeds denying
Him ² (2 Tim. iii. 5), ‘ having the form of godliness withouh the power’
(Tit. 1. 16).1 And as ‘ faibh ² thus becomes a mere ex‘cernaliby, so ‘ works '
become iden‘oified with 13119 working principle of love. It thus becomes
easy to understand how a mere shell of profession void of 13119 animating
principle of love can be compared 130 a corpse. Or we might understand
πνεῦμα of ⁶ breath ' as in Ps. cxlvi. 4, Isa. xi. 4, Apoc. xi. 11, xiii. 15 (so
Peile and Basse‘ot), which would give a simpler illustrabion : as a body

¹ The Hebrew word for ‘ body' is used sor the essenee of a thing, see J.F. p. 76.
