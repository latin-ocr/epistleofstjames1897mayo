Π 5] Norfis 139

stand πρός to mean ‘towards' or ‘ with a view to‚⁷ as Bede above,
‘ Does the Spirit desire that you should be envious one 01 another 2 '
Calvin 4 Is the Spirit of God disposed to envy 2 ' so too Bloomfield :
Beza and Estius translate 4 spiritus lacinanus ad invidiam proclivis .·
Bouman after Wolf and Witsius ‘ Does the Spirit move you to envy ’Ζ ’
As to this interpretation, while it may be granted that ἐπιποθεῖ 15
occasionally followed by πρὸς in Hellenistic writers (as in Psa. xlii. l
quoted above), this is only allowable in describing wal-m affection
towards a person, never in speaking of a tendency to a certain state 01
mind. Stil] less can ἐπιποθεῖ have the causative force assigned to it
by Wolf. (c) Others take πρός to mean 4 up to,⁷ Lat. usque, as the third
interpreter in Bede quoted above, and von Soden ‘ bis zur Eifersucht
liebt er den Geist) Praetically this is much the same as the correct
interpretation, but the former is without precedent, while the latter is
in accordance with analogy, and flows naturally from the ordinary use
01 πρός to express 4 in conformity with.' (cl) Michaelis, Semler, and
Spitta translate ‘in reference to envy,' connecting it with λέγει. This
would naturally be expressed by περί, and the interpretation is also
open to the objections stated under (l).

(3) Bede, Cyril‚ Methodius and Euthymius rightly regard τὸ πνεῦμα
(the Divine Spirit) as the subject 01 ἐπιποθεῖ. Others makew‘y γραφή th&
subject, as Theophylact, Oecumenius, and in later times Gebser and
Theile (a). Others, as Kern ‘and XViesingen take God to be the
subject understood and τὸ πνεῦμα (the human spirit) the object (b).
Practically there is not much difference between these interpretatione
and that which Ι regard as the right one. Of the two (b) has far more
claim to consideration than (a). A third view (c) which makes the
human spirit the subject seems to me entirely to destroy the meaning
01 the passage. (cl) Spitta with his usual originality makes ὃ φθόνος
(understood from πρὸς φθόνον) the subject, and τὸ πνεῦμα, which he takes
of the spirit 01 prophecy‚ the object. He illustrates this from Test.
Sim 3 ὁ φθόνος κυριεύει πάσης τῆς διανοίας τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, and from the
story 01 Eldad and Modad in Num. xi. 24:29, where Moses rebukes
Joshua in the words μὴ ζηλοῖς σὺ ἐμέ,· καί τις δῴη πάντα τὸν λαὸν κυρῖου
προφήτας, ὅταν δῷ κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ atmiis,- ΗΘ further quotes
Midrasch Beinidkar r. par. 15, to the effect that the seventy elders
were moved with envy against the unauthorized prophets who had
received a larger measure of the Spirit than they had themselves,
without being elated thereby. This, he thinks, suggests the quotation
from Proverbs which follows in ver. 6. He then refers to the words
cited from the apocryphal book Eldad and Modad in Hermas Vis. ii. 3.
and (probably) in Cleln. Rom. i. 23 ταλαίπωροι οἱ δίψυχοι, 17 ἐγὼ δέ εἶμι
ἀτμὶς ἀπὸ κύθρας, as proving that the book was familiar to the writer 01
our Epistle. He objects to the interpretation which Ι have followed

(βδ. πᾶσαν τὴν ὕβριν Ἰακώβ). Ηο suggests too that in an original chrcw phrase to
the effect ‘ the Spirit which he made to dwell in this flesh' the word translated 4 111’
(2) might also be translated ‘against,' as where it is used after a verb meaning to
envy in Gen. xxx. 1, Numb. 5. 14, Psa. xxxvii. 1, lxxiii. 3. Still this leaves
several steps wanting before we could accept Resch’s view.
