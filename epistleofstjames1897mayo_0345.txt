in the beart, not its manifestation in the words which the Christian
should seek to get rid of. But St. J ames here speaks as below in ch. iii.
and as our Lord in Matt. xv. 18, 19 of defilement arising from words :
before we can receive the word of God into our hearts we must prepare
the way by laying aside this open outward siu. (2) ‘rank growth‚’
‘Auswuchs,' with reference to the ground which has to be prepared for
sowing the seed of the word : so Alf„ Bassett (who translates, clearing
away every kind of ‘ rubbish‚ ῥυπαρία, and overgrowth '), Heisen‚
Loesner, Pott, comparing Philo M. 2. p. 258 περιτέμνεσθε τὰς σκληρο-
καρδίας, τὸ δέ ἐστι, τὰς περιττὰς φύσεις τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ, ἃς αἶ ἅμετροι τῶν
παθῶν ἕσπειροὶν τε καὶ συνηύξησαν ὁρμαὶ καὶ ὁ κακὸς ψυχῆς γεωργὸς ἐφύτευ-
σεν, ἀφροσύνη, μετὰ σπουδῆς ἀποκείρασθε. Ii] does not however appear
to be proved that either περισσεία or (still less> ῥυπαρία would bear the
meaning suggested. (3) Hofinann‚ after Gebser and others, takes it
in the sense of ‘residuum‚' ‘what is left over and above-⁷ : the Christians
addressed have already renounced sin, but still sin is not entirely
vanquished in ῖ11ο111.ὓ It is true that περισσεία is not found in this
sense, which would rather require περίσσευμα but we have περισσός
EXOd. X. 5 (the locust) κατέδεται πᾶν τὸ περισσὸν τῆς γῆς, τὸ καταλειφθὲν,
ὃ κατέλιπεν ἡ χάλαζα, Joseph. BJ. ii. 6. 2 (they begged the Romans
to Pity) τὰ τῆς Ιουδαίας λείψανα καὶ μὴ τὸ περισσὸν αὐτῆς ἀποῤῥιψαι τοῖς
ὠμῶς σπαράσσουσι, and SO περίσσευμα Mark viii. 8 Of the frag-
ments of the loaves. (4) Nothing need be said of the strange inter-
pretation praeputium adopted by Grotius, Hammond and Clericus,
nor of Beza’s emm-amentum = περίττωσις 01· περίττωμα. Heisen indeed
cites a similar use of περιττεία from Clem. Rom. p. 183 (which Ι am
unable to verify) 3 but what meaning could κακίας have in connexion
with the word thus understood? (5) Spstta, who refers to Ez. xxi. 26,
xxviii. 11-19, thinks it means the finery in which sin dresses itself up.
Those who take ῥυπαρία with an independent force understand it of
the special sin of uncleanness‚ but there does not seem to be any
special reference to that sin here, though there possibly may be in
iv. 4, 8 below. Κακία seems best understood here of malice : cf. Light-
foot on Col. iii. S (ἀπόθεσθε ὀργήν, θυμόν, κακίαν) : ‘ It iS not, ab least in
the N.T., vice generally, but the vicious nature which is bent on doing
hai-m to others, and is well described by Calvin (on Eph. iv, 31) <mimi
pravitas qaae humanitati ec aequitati est oppositas He refers to Trench
NT. Syma, ξ xi. p. 35 seq. It is not quite correct to say that it
always bears this force in the NT. (cf. Acts viii. 22, Matt. vi. 34), but
here the preceding ὀργή and the following πραΰτης leave little doubt as
to the meaning. [Is it possible that ῥυπαρία may be used to denote
the passively mean and base, in opposition to κακία, an active form of
vice, Which leads περισσὰ πράσσειν 2—0. T.]
