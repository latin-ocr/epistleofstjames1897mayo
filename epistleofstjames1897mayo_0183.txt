veritas stabit ct fides convalescet ct opus subsequetur ct merces ostende-
tur; xiii. 23: Ipse custodibit qm· in periculo inciderint, qui habent
operas ct fidem adfortissimmm ix. 7: omnis qut salens factusszccrtt
ct qut poterit effztycrc per opera succ vel per fidem z'n qua credidit, ‘ts
‘relinquetur dc prccdictis periculis ct videbit salutare meum. In the
last passage saith and works are mentioned as alternative grounds
of salvation, not, as in the two other passages, as constituting
together the necessary qualification3 but they all show that the
question of salvation by faith or works had been in debate before
St. Paul wrote3 cf. also vii. 24, 76-98, viii. 32-36. It is worth
noting that the Tth and the Oth chapters are included in that por-
tion of the book which Kabisch considers to have been written at
Jerusalem B.C. 31.1

It was indeed impossible that, with such texts before them as
Proverbs xxiv. 12 and Jeremiah xxxii. 19, in which God's judgment
is declared to be according to man's works, and, on the other hand,
Genesis XV. 6 and Habakkuk ii. 4, in which it is said that faith is
counted for righteousness, the question of how to reconcile the
opposing claims of faith and works should not be frequently dis-
cussed among the Jews. Lightfoot, lc, quotes many examples
from Philo and the rabbinical writers in which the case of Abraham
is cited and the saving power of saith is magnified. On the other
hand the doctrine of justification by works is put forward in the
most definite form in some of the passages cited above from 4 Ezra
or again in the Psalms of Solomon ix. 7 f. ‘O God, our works are in
the choice and power of our soul, that we should execute righteous-
ness and unrighteousness in the works of our hands...He that
doeth righteousness treasureth up life for himself with the Lord,
and he that doeth unrighteousness causeth the destruction of his
own soul.'²

The only question that can arise is as to the first use of the
phrase ‘justified by saith? The word δικαιόω 15 often used, cys,
in 1 Kings, viii. 32 δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον, δοῦναι αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν
δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ, Ρ5. cxliii. 2 οὐ δικαιωθήσεται ἐνώπιον σου πᾶς’
ζῶν, Isa. xlv. 26 ἀπὸ κυρίου δικαιωθήσονται . . . πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, Matt. xii. 37 ἐκ τῶν λόγων σου δικαιωθήσῃ; but I
am not aware of any instance of the use of δικαιοῦσθαι ἐκ πίστεως
01 ἐξ ἔργων prior to Paul and James. It does not follow that it
