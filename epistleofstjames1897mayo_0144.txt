cxxiv INTRODU OTION

warning (as in 1 Tim. v. 22), to ‘lay hands suddenly on no man ’z
all we find is a deprecation of the eagerness on the part of
individual members of the congregation to come forward as
instructors. The elders, called ‘elders of the Church' to distin-
guish them from the elders of the Jewish communsty, are
supposed either themselves to possess miraculous powers of healing
or to control the exercise of such powers on the part of others:
they are to pray for the sick and apparently to hear their confession
(v. 14, 15); but this does not imply any distinctive spiritual
authority, for in the next verse the injunction is made general,
‘ Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.⁷ It. is
interesting to compare the parallel passage in 1 Pet. r. 1-5.
There the elders hold a much more important position: they are
fellow elders of the Apostle himself, shepherds of the flock of God‚
who shall receive their reward from the chief Shepherd on his
appearance: the younger are to be subject to them. But then
follows, as 111 St. James, the extension of this injunction to all,
including the elders themselves3 πάντες δὲ ἀλλήλοις τὴν ταπεινο-
φροσύνην ἐγκομβώσασθε, ‘yea, all of you gird yourselves (cf. J oh.
xiii. 4) with humility towards one another? Further the means
enjoined by St. J ames for the miraculous healing take us back to
the earliest age of the Church. The only other reference in the
New Testament to the use of oil for the sick, is in St. Mark's
account of the mission of the Twelve, ‘They anointed with oil many
that were sick and healed them' (Vi. 13).

{ggffiinffltg No less confirmatory of an early date is the Judaic tone
of the Epistle. The change from a narrow national and
ceremonia] religion to the universal and spiritual religion
promulgated by Christ cannot be made 111 a moment, even
where the old religion is as corrupt and irrational as modern
Hinduism3 far less where there is so much to satisfy the claims
of the reason and conscience, as in the law of Moses. That law
was intended as a schoolmaster to bring men to Christ. Those
who had been duly prepared by it and ‘were waiting for the
consolation of Israel’ were able at once to welcome ‹Jesus as the
expected Messiah, to accept his spiritualization of the Law given
on Sinai, and acknowledge their own inability to fulfil the new law
of liberty except through the promised help of the Holy Spirit.
The sermons reported in the Acts scarcely go beyond this. A
few perhaps would be able to make a further advance, and confess
