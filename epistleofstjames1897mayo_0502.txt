222 OOMMEN T

not· call us to it, s or the sake of showing off our acuteness and pullingv
down others by way of exalting ourselves. Even where it is our duty
to judge, it should be done under a sense of responsibility, with the
consoiousness of our own liability to go wrong and a genuine desire for*
the improvement, not the humiliation, of the person blamed 3 and
further our judgment should be determined by the objective standard
of right, not by our private tastes or likings 3 otherwise we set up our-
selves above the law and the lawgiver. There is no fault which brings
about its own punishment more certainly than the love of fault-finding.
While we become quick to see the mote in a brother's eye, the beam is
still growing in our own. The habit of negative criticism is destruc-
tive to the creative faculty and to much besides, All human action is
more or less blundering 3 if we choose to concentrate our attention on
the blunders, and shut our eyes to the honest aim and the real good
effected in spite of the blunders, we lose the stimulus of admiration
and emulation, thus deadening within us all that makes life worth
living, if it be true, as the poet teaches‚ that ‘ we live by admiration,
hope, and love.⁷

MAKING PLANS.

Are we then to live at hap-hazard2 not to use our best endeavours
to foresee the future and shape our actions in accordance with proba-
bilitiesz This would be to give up one main use of reason. WVhen our
Lord said ‘take no thought (RV. ‘be not anxious⁷) for the mort-ow,
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself' (Matt. vi.
34), he did not mean to forbid serious consideration of the course to
be adopted under given circumstances He did not mean that it
was wrong to make engagements beforehand and to take steps to
keep our engagements 3 that it was wrong for a man to deliberate
ca1·efully before choosing a profession or accepting a post which
might be offered him3 or again, that it was wrong for a states-
man to consider carefully what measures 116 should bring forward
in Parliament. His meaning was that we should not worry our-
selves with the anticipation of evil: we should make all due pre-
paration for it, and then await it calmly in reliance upon God.
As Christ forbade undue anxiety, 50 St. James here forbids undue
confidence. We should bear in mind that we cannot foresee the issues
of things, so that what we think desirable now, may turn out here-
after to have been undesirable 3 and again that the best-laid plans
are liable to fail 3 so that, however good the object, still it may be
unattainable by us, that we should therefore not stake our life, as it
were, on a single throw of the dice, but join with all our plans for the
future the reservation ‘if God will,' and the aspiration ‘Thy will be
done.⁷ Some people‚ perhaps thinking of Christ’s promise of divine assist-
ance to those who should be brought before synagogues and magistrates
for his sake (Matt. X. 18), seem to have an idea that forethought and plan-
ning are in themselves opposed to saith, and that, in religious matters
especially, there is something approaching to impiety in making pre-
parations for the future. It is enough to say in answer to this, that
