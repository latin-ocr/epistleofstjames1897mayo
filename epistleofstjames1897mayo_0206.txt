clxxxvi IN TRODUGTION

antithesis, and vi. 7 Θεὸς οὐ μυκτηρίζεταιε in both cases the
absence of the article brings into greater prominence the charac-
teristic quality and connotation of the noun, not so much ‘God'
simply, but ‘ He who is God.' The rule is less strict in regard to
Κύριος, because this was freely used without the article in the
LXX, for the Sacred Name: so we find it in quotations (Rom. iv.
8, ix, 28, 29, 1 Cor. iii. 20), especially in the phrase λέγει Κύριος
(Acts vii. 49, xv. 17), but also in other passages, as Mark xiii. 20,
Acts xii. 11. Α similar word is Χριστός, which in the Gospels
usually has the article, meaning ‘the Anointed One,' but in the
Epistles has become a proper name and drops the article. It has
been often debated whether νόμος is used in a similar way without
the article to denote the Mosaic law. It is used of this with the
article ii. 10 ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ, 11. 9 ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ
νόμου, but without the article in ii. 11 «γένγονας παραβάτης νόμον]Ἰ
iv. 11 οὐκ εἶ ποιητὴς νόμον, in both which cases the R. V. has
‘ the law,' but perhaps the Greek would be more exactly given by
a compound, ‘law-breaker‚’ ‘law-observer.' So iv. 11 ὁ κατα·
λαλῶν ἀδελφοῦ...καταλαλεῖ νόμον καὶ κρίνει νόμον, where also
R. V. has ‘the law,⁷ but perhaps a more correct rendering would
be ‘speaks against law and judges law‚’ the absence of the article
serving‚ as in the case of Θεός above, to give prominence to the
connotation of the noun. A similar word is λόγος, which is found
with the article in i. 21 τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον; without it in i. ‘22
ποιηταὶ λόγου, 23 ἀκροατὴς λόγου, in both of which the R. V. has
‘the word,⁷ but the inore strict interpretation would be ‘word-
doers,' ‘ word—hearer.'

A noun may be qualified by the addition of an adjective or
participle, or of a genitive, or an adverb or adverbial phrase. If the
article is used, a noun thus qualified may take one of three forms,
either (1) ὁ καλὸς παῖς, ὁ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς πατήρ, or (2) ὁ παῖς ὁ καλός,
τὴν δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐκ τοῦ νόμον Rom. X. 5, or (3) the less common
παῖς ὁ καλός, ἐν πίστει τῇ τοῦ Tio& τοῦ Θεοῦ Gal. ii. 20. With the
genitive or adverbial phrase we find also, instead of the more
idiomatic (1) or (2), the loose collocation (4) τὴν πίστιν τοῦ
Κυρίου, where the article is attached to the governing substantive,
which is either followed or preceded by the genitive or adverbial
phrase. Of (1) we have the following examples: τὸν τίμιον καρ-
πόν v. 7, τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς iii. 13, τὸν ἔμφυτον λόγον i. 213
of (2) τὴν ἐσθῆτα τῆν λαμπράν 11. 3, τῇ φύσει τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ iii. 7,
