HARNACK ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE clxvii

22): some of the deacons are charged with defrauding orphans and
widows (Sim. ix. 26. 2).

Surely no unprejudiced person who will weigh these passages
can help seeing that it must have taken many years to change the
Church and the teaching of St. James into the Church and the
teaching of Hermas. A long process of development must have
been passed through before the simple, practical religion of the
one could have been transformed into the fanciful schematism¹ and
formalism of the other. Still more striking is the contrast of the
two men: the latter the Bunyan, as he has been called, of the
Church’s silver age, but a Bunyan who has lost his genius,
and exchanged simplicity for uatveta‘ and his serious heavenward
gaze for a perpetual smirk of sex-consciousness 2 and sels-conscious-
ness3 the former a greater Ambrose of the heroic age, his
countenance still lit up with the glory of one who had been
brought up in the same household with the Lord, and who
kept and pondered the words which had fallen from His lips.

It only remains to give Harnack's views as to the integrity of
the Epistle. Place it in what year he will, he finds it impossible
to be satisfied. It is paradox from beginning to end. There is
no system, no connexion. The use of the word πειρασμός· 111 chap.
1. is inconsistent with the use of πειράζομαι a few lines below, A
portion of the Epistle reads like a true reproduction of the words
of the Lord, plain, ene1·geti0‚ profound ; another portion resembles
the Hebrew prophets3 another is in the best style of Greek
rhetori03 another exhibits the theological controversialist. But
the most paradoxical thing of all is that, in spite of this diversity,
there is still perceptible an inner unity both of thought and
expression. The only explanation seems to be that it is an
amalgamation of homiletical fragments originally written by a
Christian teacher about 125 A‚D., and put together and edited
after the death of the writer, probably without any name or
address. Then, at the end of the century, it occurred to some one
to publish it, under the name of St. J ames, as an epistle addressed
to the Twelve Tribes, 220„ to the Church at large.

This account of the Epistle seems to me worth notice as showing
that the Tiibingen solution of the problem of authorship is found
to be inadequate even by the ablest supporter of the Tubingen
