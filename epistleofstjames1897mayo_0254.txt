of ἐπιποθεῖ by convalescit in iv. 5, are also cited as evidences of a
different original.1

Before dealing with these arguments it may be well to turn to
the Greek text itself and see whether it reads like an original or a
translation. It must be granted that this is not altogether an
easy matter to decide. There are no doubt many translations
which tell their character at once 3 translations from Oriental
languages, which seem to make it their aim to exhibit in the
crudest colours the contrast of eastern and western thought and
speech; translations from the German, which faithfully preserve
the heavy prolixity of the origina13 or translations which betray a
different origin by their affectation of F rench elegance and light-
ness. The case however even here would be complicated‚ if it were
a question whether a particular book were an original, written,
say, by an Anglicized German, or a translation from the German
by an Englishman3 and this is really the question before us; for
all that could be claimed for our Epistle‚ supposing it not to be a
translation from the Aramaic, is that it was written by a Greek—
speaking J ew. So much is plain from the style and vocabulary‚
even if we were entirely in the dark as to the writer. There is
however nothing in it of the scrupulous anxiety of a translator
cautiously treading in the footsteps of his author. On the con-
trary, it is written in strong, simple Greek, used with no slight
rhetorical skill by one who has something of his own to say, and
says it with perfect freedom. If a translation, it is atranslation of
the stamp of our authorized English version, or of Luther's German
version, which have become the recognized standards and rnodels
of excellence in their respective languages. But the frequent use
of the different figures of speech, alliteration‚ homoeoteleuton, Sco„
to which attention has been called in a previous chapter, is an
ornament which a translator is hardly likely to venture upon for
himself, and which it will often be impossible to reproduce in a
different language. If we compare χαίρειν and χαράν 2 in i. 1, 2,

¹ Bp. W. also quotes the Coi-bey version, res vestrae for ἱμάτια 111 v. 2, as pointing
to ‘the double sense of the Syriae and Chaldee ‘mam’ which stands here in the
Peshitto for ‘garment‚’ but is commonly used for ‘goods’ of any kind. In the
Classical Review v. 68 I have adduced a parallel from Rufinus’ version of Euseb.
HE. ii. 23 (a fuller) λαβὼν τὸ ξύλον ἐν ᾧ ἀπεπίεζε τὰ ἱμάτιαίῑιίἰο arreptofuste in quo
res cccprz'mere solent, which may suggest that this use of res was not more uncommon
in the later Latin than the colloquial use of ‘ things' for ‘ clothes' in English.

² The use of χαίρειν 111 itself is strongly opposed to the idea of an Aramaic original,
which would naturally have used the word meaning ⁴ Peace‚’ as the Peshitto does ;
:md this would have rendered impossible the play on words contained in χαράν.
