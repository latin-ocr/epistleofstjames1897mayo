1 6] NOTEs 39

πᾶσα ’γυνὴ γεννᾷ ; Clem. Hom. 11. 40 περὶ τοῦ μόνου Θεοῦ διακριθῆναι οὐκ
ὀφειλεις, Socr. II.E. iii. 9 διεκρίνετο κοινωνεῖν Εὐσεβίῳ. The acb. is also
used in the sense of ‹listinguishing‚ discerno, Mam. xvi. 3, Acts XV. 9
οὐδὲν διέκρινεν μεταξὺ ἡμῶν τε καὶ αὐτῶν, xi. 12 μηδὲν διακρίναντα (making
no distinction), l Cor. xi. 29 μὴ διακρίνων τὸ σῶμα (not distinguishing
the body of Christ from common food), xvi. 29 (discerning of spirits),
so Herm. chmd. ii. 6 quoted 011 ἁπλῶςῑ also of deciding (jndging) I
Cor. Vi. 5 ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ, ΕΖ. XXXiV. 17 προβάτου καὶ προβάτου,
and with acc. of person 1 Cor. xi. 31, as in Psa. xlix, 4 διακρῖναι τὸν
λαὸν αὐτοῦ, Ρ1·ον. xxxi. 9, Zach. iii. 7.¹ The force of the word here
may be illustrated by iv, 4 below and by Matt. vi. 24. Hermas para-
phrases it by αἰτοῦ ἇδιστάκτως Mcmd. ix,5 a passage full of reminiscences
of St. James. Μηδέν is required by the imperative, see WViner, p. 598.

ἕοικεν κλύδωνι.] Like a cork floating on the wave, now carried
towards the shore, now away from it 5 opposite to those who have ‘ hope
as an anchor of the seul, sure and steadfast, and which entereth
within the veil,' Heb. vi. 19. For the figure cf. Eph. iv. 14, where
we have opposed to the ἀνὴρ τέλειος Of V. 13 νήπιοι κλυδωνιζόμενοι καὶ
περιφερόμενοι παντὶ ἀνέμῳ τῆς διδασκαλίας, Sir. xxxiii. 2 ὁ ὑποκρινόμενος
ἐν νόμῳ ὡς ἐν καταιγίδι πλοῖον. In Isa. lvii. 20 the sea is used as a
type of restlessness, cf. Jude 13. For a similar figurative use of
the name ‘Euripus ' see my note on Cic. N.D. iii. 24. So Matt. xi. 7
κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον, Virg. Aen. xii. 487 vario nequiquam
fluctuat aestu, Hor. Ep. i. l. 99 aestuat et vitae disconvenit ordine toto,
Seneca Ep. 95. 57 uon continyit tranquillitas uisi immutabile ceo-tumque
judicium adeptis .· ceteri decidunt subinde et reponuntur et inter intermissa
appetitaque alternis fluctuantur, ib. 52 fluctuamus inter varia consilia,
niliil libere volumus, nihil absolute, nihil semper. Κλύδων is only found
in the sing„ Cf. Luke viii. 24 ἐπετίμησεν τῷ ἀνέμῳ καὶ τῷ κλύδωνι τοῦ
ὕδατος, and see Essay on Style. The word ἔοικε only here and below
ver. 23 in the N.T.

&veptzope'vq’.]=classical ἀνεμόω. Perhaps coined by the writer. The
only other examples quoted in 'Phayer are Schol. on Od. xii. 336,
Hesych. s.v. ἀναψύξαι, Joan. Moschus ἀνεμίζοντος τοῦ πλοίου. Heisen
notices (p. 441) that St. James has a fondness for verbs in -ιζω, eg.
ὀνειδίζω, ῥιπίζω, παραλογίζομαι, φλογίζω, ἐγγίζω, καθαρίζω, ἁγνίζω, ἀφανίζω,
θησαυρίζω, θερίζω, στηρίζω, μακαρίζω. “

ῥιπιζομένῳ] From ῥιπίς, ‘ a fan ' 3 most often used of fanning a flame.

¹ Hofmann, followedby Erdmann, explains διακρινόμενος here as middle, ‘ sich bei
sich selbst in Bezug auf etwas fraglich stellen,' and supports this by a reference to
4 Mace. 2 (it should be i. 14) διακρίνωμεν δὲ τί ἐστιν λογισμὸς καὶ τὶ πάθος, where
however διακ. has nothing to do with questioning, bnt means simply ‘let us dis-
tinguishss Dr. Abbott also would prefer to take it as a middle, comparing such cases
as Eur. Med. 609 ὡς οὐ κρινοῦμαι τῶνδέ σοι τὰ πλείονα ‘I will (lebate the matter no
fnrther‚’ Arist. Nub. 66 τέως μὲν οὖν ἐκρινόμεθ’ (cf. the Latin cernere ball0); and he
thin‘ks διεκρίθη may be used with a middle force, like ἀπεκρίθη for ἀπεκρίνατο. The
idea of sels-<lebate is much the same as that of sels-division, and it may well be that
the sense here takes a colour from the secondary, as well as from the primitive force
of the verb κρίνω, but the connexion with the primitive notion ‘division’ is, I think,
the more important, and harmonizes better with the word δίψυχος, which appears as
a synonym just below.
