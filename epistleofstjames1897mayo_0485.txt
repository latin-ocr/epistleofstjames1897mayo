RESPECT OF PERSONS.

It is to 116 feared that, if St. James were to visit our English
¹churches, he would not find much improvement 011 the state of things
rexisting in the congregationis of which he speaks While there is
perhaps no objection either to the appropriation of sittings‚ in so far
as it assures to regular attendants the right to sit in their accustomed
place, or to the exactment of a fixed payment from the well-to-do
members of the congregation for the 1156 of their seats3 it is surely
most contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that all the best scats should
Δ 116 monopolised by the highest bidders. The poor are at any rate not
to 116 at a disadvantage in the House of God. The free and open seats
should at least 116 as good as the paying seats, and it should not be in
the power of a seat-holder to prevent any unoccupiecl sitting from
being used.

But the principle here inculcated goes much further than the particular
>example given. If it is wrong to thrust the poor into bad places in
church, it is also wrong to treat them with disrespect in our ordinary
intercourse. St. J ames had before} spoken of the change brought
about by Christianity in the feelings of the rich and poor themselves : the
rich brother was to exult in his humiliation, i.e. in the feeling of

⁷ common brotherhood which unites all Christians to Christ, and in the

special offligation, which lies upon one who is specially favoured, to use
his talents and his means for the common good ; the poor brother was
to exult in his admission to the full rights and privileges of a member
of Christ and a child of God. Here he is speaking of the duty of
Christians generally towards these two extremes, Apparently he
allows of no difference in our behaviour towards them. Our behaviour
towards both should be governed by the simple rule laid down by St.
Peter, ‘honour all men.' This does not mean that we are to show
