Ι 8-10] NOTES 43

in the law (Rom. ii. 17, 23), a boasting of self-righteousness towards
God (Rom. iii. 27, iv. 2, 1 Cor. i. 25). iv. 7), an actual boasting in sin
(l Cor. v. 6), or on the ground of mere carnal advantages (2 Cor. xi.
18, Gal. vi. 13). It is used below of blamable sels-confidente (iv, lss).

ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ταπεινός.] WH. bracket tho former 5, which is omitted
in B. This would leave no doubt that ἀδελφός was a general term
applying to both πλούσιος and ταπεινός. Even With the article this iS
the natural way of taking it. The objections will be considered below,
Ταπ. here refers to outward condition as in Luke i. 52 καθεῖλε δυναστάς
...infirmae ταπεινούς, Rom, xii. 16 μὴ τὰ ὑψηλὰ φρονοῦντες ἀλλὰ τοῖς ταπει-
νοῖς συναπαγόμενοι, ef. below ii. 5 3 in iv. 6 ταπ. refers to the character.
Spitta quotes Sir. Xi. l, σοφία ταπεινοῦ ἀνυψώσει κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν
μέσῳ μεγιστάνων καθίσει αὐτόν.

10. ὁ δε πλούσιος ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ.] ‘ Leb ’che rich brother glory in
his humiliation as a Christian⁷z cf. Sir. 3. 18 ὅσῳ μέγας εἶ τοσούτῳ

μεγαλύνονται. We might understand ταπ. with reference to the loss of
position, the scorn which one who became a Christian would have to
suffer from his unbelieving fellow-countrymen (l Cor. iv, 10-13) 3 but
it seems better to refer it, like ὕψος above, to the intrinsic effect of
Christianity in changing our view of life. As the despised poor learns
sels-respect, so the proud rich learns self-abasement, cf. Luke xxii. 26
ὅ ἡγούμενος ὡς ὃ διακονῶν, Phil. iii. 3-8. Alf„ after Bede‚ Pott, Huther
and others, distinguishes 5 πλούσιος from 5 ἀδελφός on the ground (l) that
the rich in this epistle are always spoken of in terms of great severity
(ii. 6, V. 1 foll.) 3 (2) that παρελεύσεται and μαρανθήσεται are not appro-
priate if spoken of a brother. He therefore supplies καυχᾶται, not
καυχάσθω, after ὁ πλούσιος, with the sense ⁶ whereas the rich man glories
in his debasement‚’ and illustrates it from Phil. iii. 19 ὧν ἡ δόξα ἐν τῇ
αἰσχύνῃ αὐτῶν. But ταπείνωσις never bears this sense in the Hellenistic
writers. It and its cognates are used either in a good sense morally
(as below iv. 6, 10), or of mere outward humiliation (as in Luke i. 48)
ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης αὐτού, Sir. 2. 5 ἅνθρωποι λεκτοὶ
δοκιμάζονται ἐν καμίνῳ ταπεινώσεως, ib. Xi. 13, XX. 10, Psa. CXiX. 50, 67,
71, 1 Maec. iii. 51, 2 Sam. xvi. 12, Neh. ix. 9). In the next place such a
change of mood in the verb to be supplied is extremely harsh‚ and I
think Alf. stands alone in supposing it possible. Equally impossible
is the supposition of Oecumenius‚ Grotius and others that some such
word as αἰσχυνέσθω 01· ταπεινούσθω should be supplied. HOWever we
understand πλούσιος, no interpretation is admissible which does not
supply the imperative καυχάσθω. Bede, followed by Huther and
Beyschlag, has attempted to reconcile this with the idea of πλούσιος,
