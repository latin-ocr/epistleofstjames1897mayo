18 περιτετμημένος τις ἐκλήθη ,· μὴ ἐπισπάσθω· ἐν ἀκροβυστίᾳ κέκληταί τις ,-
μὴ περιτεμνέσθω, ib. ver. 27 δέδεσαι γυναικί; μὴ ζήτει λύσιν. λέλυσαι ἀπὸ
γυναικός,· μὴ ζήτει γυναῖκα, ib. ver. 21 δοῦλος ἐκλήθης ,· μή σοι μελέτω, Sir.
vii. 22-26: also in profane Greek Dem. Cor. p. 317. 15 ἀδικεῖ τις ἑκών,·
ὀργὴ καὶ τιμωρία κατὰ τούτου· ἐξήμαρτέ τις ἄκων ; συγγνώμη ἀντὶ τῆς τιμωρίας
τούτῳ, id. A‘szrot. 601 ἀσθενέστερος εἶ,· τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἐφηγοῦ· φοβῇ καὶ
τοῦτο ; γράφου, JUV. 3. 100 rides, maiore cachinno excutitur with Mayor’s
n., Roby Gr. ξ 1553, 1555. In Latin the protasis is usually regarded
as a categorica] assumption, and so some would take it here, and even
in such, forms as that in iii. 13, where the sentence begins with the
interrogative pronoun. The interrogative is more in accordance with
the vivacity which characterizes St. J ames.

ε’ν ὑμῖν.] See above 111. 13 and l Cor. XV. 12 λέγουσίν τινες ἐν ὑμῖν.

προσευχέσθω] Instead of breaking out into oaths.

chouna] Classical, found elsewhere in N.T. only in Acts xxvii. 22, 25.

ψαλλέτω.] Properly used 01 playing on a stringed instrument, as
Luc. Paras. 17 οὕτε γὰρ αὐλεῖν ἔνι χωρὶς αὐλῶν οὕτε ψάλλειν ἄνευ λύρας.
We find it also used of singing with the voice and with the heart,
Eph. v. 19, 1 Cor. xiv. 15. The word is only used 01 sacred music in
Ν .Τ., but in Sir. ix. 4 of a hired citharistria, μετὰ ψαλλούσης μὴ
ἐνδελέχιζε.

14. ἀσθενεῖ] 681011,1 as in Matt. x. 8 and often both in classica]
and Hellenistic Greek. A special case of κακοπαθία.

τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς ἐκκλησίας] The same phrase occurs Acts xx. 17
(01 Ephesus). The ecclesiastical constitution of the Jewish churches
was developed out 01 the symmgogue, in which, if the place was populous,
there was the council 01 elders (Luke vii. 3) one or more of whom,
entitled ἀρχισύναγωγος, like Jairus (Luke viii. 41, 49), was intrusted
with the superintendence 01 the religious meetings,1 01. D. ofB. under
ί131011091 and ‘Synagogue,' also Dicet. qulcr. Ant. pp. 1699 1011. and Bothe
Die Anfc't'nye deo· clzr'istlz'claen Kirclaee, pp. 147 1011. Other references to
Christian elders are Acts xi. 30 (the church at Antioch send their 0011-
tributions to the elders at Jerusalem), ib. xxi. 18 (the elders were present
during Paul's interview with James), 1 Pet. v. 1 πρεσβυτέρους ἐν ὑμῖν
παρακαλῶ ὁ συμπρεσβύτερος. Bauch contests the genuineness 01 this
passage on the ground that the writer elsewhere speaks 01 διδάσκαλοι
and συναγωγή, not as here Of πρεσβύτεροι and ἐκκλησία, but ἐκκ. and
συν. are convertible terms, not only in early Christian literature (for
which see note on ii. 2, Sch‘urer Z.c. p. 58, Spitta p. 144, 354, and
Harnack in Zt. f. wissensch. Theol. 1876, p. 104), but in the LXX. A
reason for the use 01 ἐκκ. here may be that it is a general word for the
permanent body 01 the Church, and is appropriately used for the title
01 its ministers (01. Matt. xvii. 17 ‘if thy brother sin against thee'... ι
εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, which has much the same force as ⁶ the elders 01 the
Church’ here), while συναγ. refers strictly to the congregation in a

Eng. tr. ed, I. We learn troni Epiphanius that the ζ10111511 titles were still retained
in his time by the Ebionites of Palestine (Hcccr. xxx. 18 πρεσβυτέρους ’γὰρ οὗτοι
ἔχουσι καὶ ἀρχισυναγώγους).
