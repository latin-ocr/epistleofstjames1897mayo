clxxviii IN TRODUCTION

may have been a Jewish maxim in vogue at the time, which was
incorporated in the Sermon on the Mount at a later period. Even
if it were spoken by Christ, He may possibly have taken it from
some J ewish source of which we have no record.

On the perishableness of earthly riches the agreement is not
quite so close3 still there is much more similarity between James'
‘Go to now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are
coming upon you: your riches are corrupted and your garments
are moth-eaten; your silver and your gold are rusted, and their
rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your fiesh
as fire: ye have laid up your treasure in the last days '—there is, I
say, much more similarity between this and Matthew’s ‘Lay not
up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
corrupt,' than there is between either of these and the passage from
Enoch xcvii. 8-10 referred to by Spitta: ‘ Woe to you who acquire
silver and gold in unrighteousness, yet say, We have increased in
riche& we have posscssions, (md wc have (required everytlcz'ng] wc
desire. And now let ‘ns (ῖο that {ulrich ἀτ pzwymsffi soff¹ wo leave
yccthered sihor, and ozor qraozarz'es arc full, and plentzficl as ‘water are
tlte husbandmen in 0·chst homes. And like water your lies will flow
away 3 for riches will not abide with you, but will ascend suddenly
from you ; for ye have acquired it all in unrighteousness, and ye
will be given over to a great condemnation.'

It is, I think, unnecessary to go further. In almost every
instance in which Spitta attempts to explain away parallels be-
tween our Epistle and the Gospels‚ which have been pointed out
by commentators, his efforts seem to me to be scarcely less abortive
than in the cases Ι have examined. The authenticity of the
Epistle remains in my judgment alike impregnable to assault,
whether it be urged from the pre—Christian or from the post-
Apostolic side.
