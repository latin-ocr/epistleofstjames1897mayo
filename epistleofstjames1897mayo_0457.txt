especially if γινώσκετε is read. without these words the subject of
σώσει would naturally be understood to be ‘ one of you.'

ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὖτοΰ.] Comparing &Visd Xii. 24 τῶν πλάνης ὁδῶν μακρό-
τερον ἐπλανήθησαν Zonyius abero-abant quam erroris viae ferebant (‘ even
further than error itself ⁵) we might be disposed to make πλάνης depend
on ὁδοῦ, translating ‘ his erring path ' 3 but the usual order of words,
when the metaphorical ὁδός 15 joined with a gen. of quality, is to put
ὁδός first, as in Psa. cxix. 29, 30, ὁδόν ἀδικίας ἀπόστησον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ...ὃδο’ν
ἀληθείας ᾑρετισάμην, Prov. iV. 24 ὃὸ. εἰρήνης, ib. viii. 20 ὁδ. δικαιοσύνης,
ib. v. 6 ὁδ. ζωῆς, ih. xii. 19, XV. 25, xvii. 24, Job xxixa 13, Isa. xxvi. 7,
lix. 8. It seems better therefore to translate ‘from the error of his
way.’ In classica] prose the article would have been used both before
πλάνης and ὁδοῦ. The second article is omitted according to Hellenistic
usage because the noun is defined by the genitive of the personal
pronoun which follows it (of. ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ just below, καρδίαν αὐτοῦ,
γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ above i. 26 and WViner, p. 155 foll.), and the first article
is omitted by the ‘law of correlation ' to suit the anarthrous ὁδοῦ, asin
Matt. xix. 28 ἐπὶ θρόνου δόξης αὑτοῦ, cf. &Vinery p. 175 and A. Buttmann,
p. 104. We find the same opposition of πλάνη to ἀλήθεια 111 1 John
iv. 6 ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς
πλάν ς.

σώΊέ-ει ψυχήν.] After ψυχήν several MSS. and edd. insert αὐτοῦῑ if
this is the correct reading, it may either be understood of the subject
of the verb (zLat. suus, cf. Winer, p. 188 foll„ A. Buttmann, p. 97
foll„ Meisterhans Gr. Aa. Insclc. p. 122), or, more probably, it repeats
the preceding αὐτοῦ, in which case it may have been intentionally in-
serted to mark that this clause refers to the sinner exclusively,
allowing a wider scope to the next clause. In B. however αὐτοῦ
comes after θανάτου1 instead of after ψυχήν, suggesting that it may
have arisen from a dittography, and I think the meaning is better
without it. The future σώσει 15 easier to understand if ψυχήν refers
to the subject of the verb. ⁴ He who converts a sinner will be him—
self saved’ reads naturally enough, the one action not being either
identical or contemporaneous with the other 3 or again ‘He who con-
verts a sinner has thereby saved a soul ' 3 but there is something of
incongruity in the words ‘He who turns a sinner from the error of
his way will save that sinner's soul from death, and will cover a
multitude of sins.' The object of the writer is to stimulate and en-
courage the work of conversion to the utmost, but by the use of the
future, instead of the present2 or past, he puts off the issue of the
work to an indefinite distance of time. [Bengel explains it olim con-
stabit, it will be seen on the day of judgment that he has saved a soul
from death] Otherwise salvation is regarded and spoken of by the
writers of the NT. sometimes as a fact of the present, sometimes of'
