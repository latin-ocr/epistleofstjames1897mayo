108 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Plato Phaedon 230 D τὰ μὲν οῧν χωρία καὶ τὰ δένδρα οὐδέν με θέλει διδάσκειν,4
Ii’ep. ii. 370 οὐκ ἐθέλει τὸ πραττόμενον τὴν τοῦ πράττοντος σχολὴν περιμένειν.
For εὖθύν. Cf. Philo M. 1. p. 422 φιλεῖ γὰρ ἔστιν ὅτε χωρὶς ἡνιόχων τε
καὶ κυβερνητῶν ὅ τε πλοῦς καὶ ὃ δρόμος εὐθύνεσθαι, Eurip. Cycl. 15 ἐν

proverbial style. The horse's mouth is small in comparison to the body,
yet through it the whole body is directed 3 the rudder is small in com-
parison to the ship 3 the tongue small in comparison to the man 3 yet
control this small member and you control the whole nature. This
however is only the allegorica] outside 3 by the 511131111055 of the tongue
15 meant the insignificance‚ as we deem it, 01 speech in comparison with·
action 3 yet by controlling speech we acquire the power of controlling
action. For the metonomy by which an independent personality seems
to be attributed to the tongue‚ 50 that it stands 101 the temptations
or sins which are concerned with the use 01 the tongue, though, as
Augustine says (Sco-m. 17 cited by Corn. a Lepide), ream linquam
'non farcit m'sz‘ mens rea, compare Matt. v. 29, 30 ‘if thine eye...thy
right hand, cause 11100 to stumble'3 Matt. xv. 19 ‘the things that
come out of the mouth (lefile a 111311 '3 1 John ii. 16 ‘ the lust of the

μεγάλα αὐχεῖ] ⁴ Vaunts great things.' There 15 110 idea of vain
boasting: the whole argument turns upon the reality 01 the power
which the tongue possesses. &Vliether written 35 two words with AB,
or 35 0110 (μεγαλαυχεῖ) with Sin. K L, 1110, the phrase occurs nowhere
0150 111 Ν.Τ., but 15 found in Ezek. xvi. 50, Zeph. iii. 12 (A.V. ⁴ to be
haughty ²), Sir. xlviii. 18, 2 Maec. xv. 32, 01. Ρ5. xii. 3 γλῶσσα μεγαλορ-
ρήμων. It may be compared with the Homeric εὔχομαι εἶναι and with
Philo M. 1. p. 338 μεγάλης ψυχῆς τὸ αὔχημα γένεσιν ὑπερκύπτειν, ib. 158
τὸ δουλεύειν Θεῷ μέγιστον αὔχημα, ib. M. 2. 235 ἐγκράτεια δὲ καθαρὰ καὶ
ἀκηλίδωτος ἀρετὴ, πάντων ὅσα πρὸς βρῶσιν καὶ πόσιν ἀλογοῦσα, καὶ ἐπάνω
τῶν γαστρὸς ἡδονῶν αὐχοῦσα ἵστασθαι, βωμῶν ψαυέτω. Observe the use Of
alliteration in μ to point the conti-ast of μικρὸν μέλος μεγάλα αὐχεῖ, and
compare that in δ below ver. 8.

ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην dudm-ret] ‘ HOW small a fire kindles hOW large a

ζωπυρηθῇ μεγάλην ἐξάπτει πυράν, Phocyl. 144 ἐξ ὀλίγου σπινθῆρος ἀθέσφατος
αἴθεται ὕλη. For the double question compare Mark xv. 24 βάλλοντες
κλῆρον τίς τί ἄρῃ, and Luke xix. 15, Isocr. p. 240 οὐκ ἀγνοῶ ἡλίκος ὢν
(‘ how old,' Viz. 94) ὅσον ἔργον ἐνίσταμαι, Plato ΗΘΖ). 4, p. 423 B ἡλίκῃ

Milton PJ.. i. 91 ‘ Into what pit thou seest from what height fallen.⁷
There is no 10100 111 the objection that this interpretation gives
opposite senses to the same word in the same sentence. Literally
it is ‘ what (what-sized) a fire kindles what a forest‚' but the context
interprets the meaning of ⁴ what ⁷ in either case. In Lucian Hermot-
