second wife, though this supposition contradicts what the upholders
of this view maintain to be the very purpose of Mary’s marriage,
viz, to screen her from all injurious imputations. How could the
marriage effect this, if the husband were above eighty years of
age, as Epiphanius says, following the Apocryphal GospeJS 2 Again,
if this were the case, why should not the Evangelist have stated it
simply, instead of using the cautionary phrases πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν
and οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως οὗ ἕτεκενῖἶ But even this was not
enough for the ascetic spirit. F urther barriers must be raised
between the contamination of matrimony and the virgin ideal.
Josepl1 himself becomes a type of virginity: the ‘ brethren ² are no
longer his sons, but sons of Clopas, who was either his brother by
one tradition, or his wife’s sister's husband by another. Mary is
made the child of promise and of mii-acle like Isaac, though not
yet exalted to the honours of the Immaculate Conception3 and we
see Epiphanius already feeling his way to the doctrine of her
Assumpfflon, which was accepted by Gregory of Tours in the sixth
century. One other development may be noticed, as it is found in
the Proterawgyelium, c. ΞΟ, though not mentioned by Epiphanius,
viz. that not only the Conception but the Birth of our Lord was
miraculous 3 in the words of Jeremy Taylor ‘He that came from his
grave fast tied with a stone and signature, and into the college of
the Apostles, the doors being shut . . . came also (as the Church
piously believes) into the world so without doing violence to the
virginal and pure body of his mother, that he did also leave her
virginity enti1·e.'1

This mii-acle, superfluous as it is and directly opposed to the words

it is in reference to it that Bp. Lightfoot (Za. p. 371) thinks that too
much stress has been laid by modern writers on the false asceticism
of the early Ohurch as the only cause of the dislike to the Helvidian
view. He considers that this dislike is ‘due quite as much to an-
other sentiment which the Fathers fantastically expressed by a·
comparison between the conception and the burial of our Lord. j
As after death his body was placed in a sepulchre wherein never J
man before was laid, so it seemed fitting that the womb consecrated l
