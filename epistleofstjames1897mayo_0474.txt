REGENERATION.

It is worth while to compare the different terms used in the Bible to—
express the change wrought in man’s nature by the Divine influence.

(1) It is described as a new birth. This is expressed in the text by
the verb ἁποκυέω. St. Peter in 1115 First Epistle (i. 23) employs the·
verb ἀναγεννάω ‘ being born again not of corruptible seed, but of incor-
ruptible, through the living and abiding word of God,' cf. ib. ii. 2.
St. John has either γεννάω ἄνωθεν 01· the simple γεννάω, as 111 1. 12, 13,
‘ As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons>
of God, even to then] that believe on his name: which were born, not
of blood, nor of the will of the fiesh, nor of the will of man, but ol?
God,' ib. iii. :3 ‘except a man be born from above, he cannot see the
kingdom of God‚' this new birth being further explained by the words
in verses 5, (5, ‘except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of 13110
flesh is fiesh3 and that which is born of the Spirit 15 spirit', simi-
larly 1 ep. iii. 9 ‘every one who is born of God committeth not sin;
for 1115 seed remaineth 111 him, and he cannot sin, because he 15 born
of (1οᾶ '3 ib. v. 4 ‘whatsoever 15 born of God (πᾶν τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ
τοῦ Θεοῦ) overcometh the world3 and this is the victory that over-
cometh the world, even our faith,⁷ cf. also ii. 29, iV. 7, v. 1, 18. St.
Paul uses the word παλιγγενεσία 111 Tit. iii. 5 ‘according to his mercy
110 saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Ghost‚' and addresses the Galatians as ⁴ my little children of whom I
travail in birth until Christ be formed in you' (Gal. iv. 19).

(2) Nearly related to this 15 the description of the change as that
of adoption (υἱοθεσία) 01· sonship, for which 500 Rom. viii. 14-17, ‘As
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For
ye did not receive a spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received
a spirit of adoption, whercby we cry, Abba, Father. . . The Spirit
itself witnesseth with our spirit, that we are the children of God,⁷
cf. Gal. iv. 5, 6, Eph. i. 5.

(3) Or again, that which speaks of a new heart, a new man, a new
creation' a new nature, cf. Ezek. xi. 19 ‘I will put a new spirit
within you3 and [ will take the stony heart out of their fiesh, and will
give them a heart of flesh.' Il). xxxvi. 25-27, Jer. xxxi. 33, Ps. li. 10,
2 Cor. v. 17 ‘If any man be in Christ, he 15 a new creature (καινὴ
κτίσις) ; old things have passed away, behold all things are become neW,’
Eph. iv, 22 ‘that ye put off the old man which is being destroyed in
accordance with the lusts of deceit, and be renewed in the spirit of
your mind; and that ye put on the new man which after God 15
created in righteousness and holiness of truth,' 2 Pet. 1. 4 ‘in order
that through the promises ye may become partakers of the divine
nature‚' Gal. vi. 15, Eph. ii. 15, Col. iii. 9, 10.

(4) This new nature is further described as a resurrection from
