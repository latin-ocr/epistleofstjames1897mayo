Brtickners In a later chapter of the same volume Briickner deals with the Epistles
ξζῐξξξὲεζῇξ which he assigns to the second century as having been written after the 151 epistle
Epistle was of Peter. These are the second to the Thessalonians, and those to the Colos—
forgEed by ²²¹¹ sians and Ephesians, belonging to the earlier half of the century; and secondly,
1553?ss the Pastoral EpistleS‚ J ames, J ude, the second of Peter, and those of John, which
Rome in the he considers to have been written subsequently to 150 A.D. With regard to our
Ῑῖῗξὲξέἐξὲῗ Epistle he refers to what he has said before, as to its being copied from 1
century. Pet. and cites parallels from Romans, Corinthians, Hebrews, Apocalypse and
the Gospel of St. Matthew to show that it was written after these. In reply to

Beyschlag he asserts that the Judaizing tone of the Epistle is not the nai‘ve

J udaism of an early Jewish Christian writer, but that it implies a late stage of

the doctrina] development, inasmuch as it attacks Paulinism as the seed of

1111 existing Gnosticism. The writer betrays his Essene tendency by his pro-

hibition of swearing, his contempt for ric-hes, his dislike of trade, warning

against sins of the tongue, high esteem of poverty, &c. He takes the pseu-

‹lonym of ,1 ames, as a contemporary had taken that of Peter 3 because the tra-

ditional reputation of the ascetic president of the Church of Jerusalem seemed

likely to give most authority to his teaching. Partly in order to mark his

own opposition to all that was characteristic of Paul, partly to imitate the style

of J ames, he makes use of the simple salutation χαίρειν, which he found in a

circular ascribed to him in the Acts. The address to the Twelve Tribes of the

Diaspora cannot be taken literally. The true address reveals itself in the

phrase ‘your synagogue' (ii. 2), by which we are in all probability to under·

stand a little conventicle of Essene Christians at Rome. The phrase ‘Diaspora'

denotes similar scattered conventicles, in which alone ‘the true Israel,⁷ ‘the

poor‚⁷ are to be found. By ‘the rich,' who occasionally drop into their con-

ventieles and so cruelly oppress and persecute the brethren, is meant Chris-

tians outside of the conventicle. All the warnings of the epistle are meant to

preserve this little flock from the snares of Paulinism.

Pfleiderer's It is difficult for Englishmen 10 treat these baseless vagaries with

general view

devcgotlffientbecoming seriousness. To us they at once suggest the great
of 111351- Shakespearian Cryptogram, or somebody’s attempt to prove that the

christianin. Amzccls of Tacitus were written by a monk of the Middle AgeS. But
that we may not be too hasty in assuming that the new criticism
has nothing more solid to offer us, we will turn now to a better
known name, and examine what Pfleiderer has to tell us in his
Urelwistentlzum, which is an expansion of the Hibbert Lectures

delivered by him iu 1885.

He distinguishes two lines of development in post-Pauline Christianity. The
one, which he calls Christian Hellenism, is represented by the epistle to the
Hebrews, which he assigns to the end of the lst century, the first epistle of
Clement (between 100 and 120 Α.1).), 1116 first of Peter (not earlier than
Trajan), that of Barnabas (between 120 and 125 A.D.)‚ the epistle to the Colos-
sians and Ephesians and the Gospcl of John (about 140 A.D.>. The other,
which he ealls Antignostic Hellenism, marks the period of the Antonines. It
is again subdivided into Catholicized Hellenism and Catholicized Paulinism
(p. 845). The former branch is represented by the Johannean and the Pastoral
epistles, the epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, which with Volkmar’s
expurgations may be regarded as a fairly genuine piece, the Ignatian epistles,
together with that of J ude and the second of Peter. The latter branchis
represented by the second epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, written
