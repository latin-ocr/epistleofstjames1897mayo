IV 1-17 THE WORLD 219

passions, the subject-matter of 0111· thoughts. This environment is
partly inanimate, so far as our senses, thoughts, and appetites are con-
cerned, but far more largely human, in all that has to do with feelings,
passions‚ desires. It is the appointed training-place of the immortal
soul. But just as the inanimate world, which was intended to reveal the
glory of the eternal Godhead, was itself deified through the folly of man 3
so the world of humanity, which was intended to be a further revelation
of the inner character of God, engrosses our attention until we no
longer hear the voice of Grod speaking in conscience, but take the
custom of the world for our law, spbmit ourselves to its judgment,
strive for its prizes‚ seek its approval, in a word, worship the world as
our God. In speaking of the worl‘ we must remember that it is not
-one, but multiform. Each man's world differs from that of every
other man, depending partly on his surroundings and partly on the
working of his own mind. The same surroundings may be to one man
a channel of divine influence, to another the very embodiment of the
worldly spirit. WVhere the mind of one sees or cre-ates good in all
Δ(ιιι-0111111 him, the mind of another may be conscious only of evil, and
thus the same set of people may constitute a church to the one, a
world 130 the other. In like manner there will be a broad distinction
between man’s world and woman's world, the world of youth and the
world of agc, the world of poverty and the world of wealth. Fashion,
politics‚ religion‚-the criminal, the school—boys, the working-man-—all
have their separate worlds3 there is the world of the nun in her
convent, of the hermit in his cell. Incalculable mischief has been
caused by the imagination that the worldly spirit could be avoided by
keeping out of some particular society which men chose to identify
with the world. The world 15 in the heart of man. There may be
endless differences in point of refinement between the various forms
⁴ of the world, but in so far as they all tend to separate us from God
and lower our standard of duty, the influence of all is alike baneful.
He who makes it his chief aim to gain the favour of his world thereby
becomes an enemy of God. And yet all> the while each separate soul,
included in the aggregate of worlds, is itself the object of God’s love,
though the worldly influence, which in the Bible often goes by the
name of the world, is so hateful to God that, as we have seen, no man
can love it without becoming His enemy.

St. J ames in the text tells us that the cause of quarrelling is our
eagerness to get the world's good things, which are palpably limited
in quantity, and often derive their chief value in our eyes from their
difficulty of attainment. The fact of this limitation inevitably leaves
many disappointed of their desire. But even the successful are not
satisfied. No sooner is the coveted object attained, than the process
of disillusion commences. There is a moment’s delight at the victory
over our rivals, and again the cloud of disappointment settles over us.
We feel that, once more, happiness has eluded our grasp, and we are
filled with envy and jealousy of those whom we fancy to be in any
respect more fortunate than ourselves, till in the end we find our
nearest approach to happiness in striving to prevent or destroy the
