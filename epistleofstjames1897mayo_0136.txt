of whom, are possessed of miraculous gifts of healing; St. James
gives instructions as to the use of this gift (v. 14, 15). Their
place of meeting is the synagogue, to which strangers are admitted
(ii. 2—4). They are exposed to trials of many kinds, especially
from their rich oppressors, and it is one main object of the Epistle
to encourage them to patient endurance (i. 2, 12, ii. 6, V. 7, 8, 10,
11). There is much however to blame in themselves: their faith
is very weak3 they are inclined to murmur and complain both
against God and against man (i. 6-8, 13, iv. 11, v. 9); their re-
ligion and their philanthropy alike are a matter of words and
forms, without corresponding feelings and actions (i. 22, 25-27, ii.
14-26); they are deficient in genuine love of man as man3
they are haughty to the poor, obsequious to the rich (ii. 1—9,
15, 16). They are censorious, quarrelsome‚ given to oaths, am-
bitious, sels-confident, eager to set themselves up as teachers,
greedy of pleasure, forgetful of God (iii. 1, 6, 9, 14«, iv. 1—8, 13,
16, v. 12).

How far do these characteristics agree with what we read else—
where? First, as to the rich oppressore: I have pointed out, in
my note on ii. 6, that these were in all probability Jews. The
Gentiles for a long time took no interest in the interna] disputes
of Jewish sects: they might punish the Christian missionaries
as disturbers of the public peace, but they were very un-
likely ‘to blaspheme Christ’ themselves (James ii. 7). Again, if
they were Gentiles, why should the rich, rather than the poor,
take the trouble to persecute such an insignificant body? In
Ephesus and Philippi, it is the rabble who make the loudest out-
cry against the Christians. On the other hand, if we turn to the
Jews, we find that the rich were as a fact the leaders in the
persecutions. It was the party of the high priest, the wealthy
Sadducees (J os. Ant. xviii. 14), who laid hold of the Apostles, as
recorded in Acts iv. 1—3); it was with their sanction and that of
the Sanhedrin in general, including the Pharisaic section (Acts xxii.
5, xxvi. 10, 12), both being combined against the disciples, as they
had been against their Master (J oh. xi. 47, 57, xviii. 3, Matt. xxvi.
3), that Saul, the Pharisee, took the lead in the stoning of Stephen
and the ensuing raid on the Church (Acts viii. 1, ix. 1, 2, 21) ; 1 at
