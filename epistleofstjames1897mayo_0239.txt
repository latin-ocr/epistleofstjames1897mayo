Of the unusual words mentioned above it is to be noted that
some are of a technical nature, connected with fishing, as ἀνεμίζω,
ῥιπίζω, ἐνάλιος, ἐξέλκω, ἁλυκόν. Possibly the last may have
been a local expression for a salt spring. Others are connected
with husbandry‚ as ἀμάω, βρύω, ἐπιτήδεια, κατιόω, μαραίνω
ὅψιμος, πρόϊμος, σέσηπε, σητόβρωτος. Others however are per-
fectly general, as ἀνέλεος, πολύσπλαγχνος, ἀπείραστος, θρησκός,
εὐπειθής. Then there are otherS, very common in classical Writers,
which we wonder not 10 find used in the other parts of the N.T.‚
such as χρή, «γέλως, ἔοικε, ὕλη, ἁπλῶς, πικρός, ταχύς, λείπεσθαι
‘to be wanting in.' In some cases this absence may be due to
accident, since we find other forms of the same 310111 commonly
used. Thus we have many instances of ἐν τάχει, and we find also
ταχινός, ταχέως, ταχύ, τάχιον, τάχιστα. In like manner we find
πικρία, πικραίνω, πικρῶς, «γελᾶν and καταγελᾶν, ἁπλοῦς and
ἁπλότης. Τ11010 13 110 mention of forests in the NT. except in St.
,J ames, which accounts 101 ὕλη 1101 being found: but χρή and ἔοικε
stand on another footing. For the latter we always have ὅμοιός
ἐστι 111 1110 other books3 and for the former either δεῖ (used some-
times where a classica] writer would certainly have preferred χρή)
01 ὀφείλω. It appears then that, so far as the use 01 111030 two

1 χρή 13 omitted in the Concordances to the LXX.
