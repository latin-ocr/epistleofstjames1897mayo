v 5-7] NOTEs 155

...ἐνεδρεύσωμεν τὸν δίκαιον ὅτι δύσχρηστος ἡμῖν ἐστιν-..ἀλαζονεύεται πατέρα
Θεόν...εἷ γάρ ἐστιν ὃ δίκαιος υἱὸς Θεοῦ, ἀντιλήψεται αὐτοῦ κ.τ.λ., 6 passage
regarded by some of the Fathers and by many in later times as prophetie
of Chris& by others it has been thought to be a Christian interpola-
tion. W⁷e may compare other parts of the same book, eff. iii. 1, iv. 7,
as well as Isa. iii. 10 δήσωμεν τᾶν δίκαιον ὅτι δύσχρηστος ἡμῖν ἐστίν (from
which the passage in Wisdom is borrowed), ib. ch. liii., Prov. i. 11,
Α11105 v, 12, Matr.. xxiii. 35, xxvii. 19, 24, 1 John ii. 1, 111. 12, Acts iii.
14, vii. 52, xxii. 14, 1 Pet. iii. 18, Luke xxiii. 47. These passages
might suggest that we have here a direct reference to the Crucifixion,
biit in any ease ὁ δίκαιος must be regarded as generic and not confined
to one individual. Thus the words are applicable to the writer him-
self, who was known to all the Jews as the Just, cf. the account
of his death in Euseb. HJJ, ii. 23, taken from Hegesippus: διὰ τὴν
ὑπερβολὴν τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ ἐκαλεῖτο Δίκαιος καὶ Ὠβλίας, 13116 Jews
ran upon him crying out ὢ ὣ καὶ ὃ δίκαιος ἐπλανήθη...λιθάσωμεν τὸν
δίκαιον, herein fulfilling the prophecy 111 Isa. iii. lO (as Hegesippus
says). One of the priests in vain tried to save him with the words
παύσασθε, τί ποιεῖτε,· εὔχεται ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ὁ δίκαιος. See below V. 16.

οὐκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν.] The subject here is ὃ δίκαιος. A more regular
construction would be οὐκ ἀντιτασσόμενον, but the abrupt change to
direct statement is a far more graphio way of putting 13116 fact. For
the change from aor. to present we 'may compare the similar passage
in Isa. 1111. ’5-7 ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν. . ,καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ κεκα-
κῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα· ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη, καὶ ὡς ἀμνὸς
...οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα. Τ116 present brings the action before our eyes
and makes us dwell upon thie, as the central point, in contrast with
the accompanying circumstances. Others (Hofmann, Erdmann, (lc)
take the verb as an impersonal passive, like ἀφεθήσεται below v. 15,
meaning ‘ no opposition is needed,’ ‘you have your way ' 3 but no
instance of this use has been pointed out. It is the middle, not the
active, which means to resist, as above iv. 6, and Rom. xiii. 2, Acts
xviii. 6, 1 Kings xi. 34, Hos. i. 6. The only example of the passive in
the LXX. is PrOV. iii. 15, where it means ‘ shall not be compared with
her,' lit. ⁶ set against her.' The clause is made interrogative by WH., 65
by Benson, understanding ὁ Κύριος (cf. above iv. 6),1 which was actually
substituted for οὐκ by Bentley <ORE for OYK), but I agree with Herder
that this gives a less natural and a less pathetic sense than the reading
of the MSS. For the thought see Matt. v. 39, Rom. xii. 19, 1 Pet.
11. 23 3 and for asyndeton the Essay on Οτι-611111161- and ii. 13 above.

7 μακροθυμήσατε οὖν] Turning to the oppressed brethren St. J ames
urges patience upon them byvffi‘e example of ‘ the just‚' and because it ’
15 now the last time, the day of slaughter, and their cries have gone
up to the Lord of Sabaoth. As γλυκύθυμος means ‘sweet-tempered,²
ὀξύθυμος ‘quick-tempered,' 50 μακρόθυμος 15 literally ‘long-tempered,'
the opposite to our ‘ short—tempered.' In ΝΤ. we find μακρόθυμος used
of God (Rom. ii. 4, 1 Pet. iii. 20), of man (below v. 10 and 2 Gor. vi. 6,,

¹ Dr. Abbott would understand ὁ δίκαιος with much 1116 same sense.
