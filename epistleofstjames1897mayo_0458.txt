the absence of the article) the last note and 1 Pet. iii. 3 ὀφθαλμοὶ
Κυρίου ἐπὶ δικοιους καὶ ωτα αὐτοῦ εἰς δέησιν αυτῶν The omission is espe-
cially common with the word ψυχή, Heb. Χ. 39 εἷς περιποίησιν ψυχῆς,

καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν.] Α proverbial expression, which occurs also
in 1 Pet. iv. S ἀγάπη καλύπτει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν, and Which Resch
regards as one of the unwritten words of Christ, quoting Olem. Al.
Paed. iii. 12. p. 306, where it is introduced by φησί, which he
understands of Christ· but as the immediately preceding references
in Clement 316 to the O..T it is more natural to supply Θεός or
ἡ γραφή. It is however ascribed to Christ in Didascalia ii. 3 λέγει
Κύριος ἀγάπη καλύπτει κ. τ, λ. The originalis found' 111 Prov. X. 12 (Heb.
not LXX.)‘ hate stiireth up stiife, but love covereth all transgi-es
510115,’ cf. Psa. IXXXV.⁰ ..ι ἀφῆκας τὰς ἀνομίας τῷ λαῷ σου, ἐκάλυψας πάσας
τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν, ib. xxxi. 1, 2, N ehem. iv. 5 μὴ καλύψῃς ἐπὶ ἀνομίαν,
Ep. ad Diogn. C. 9 τί γὰρ ἄλλο τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν ἠδυνήθη καλύψαι ἢ
ἐκείνου (Χριστοῦ) δικαιοσύνη ,· and a saying attributed to Socrates in
Stob. F lor. xxxvii. 27 ἡ μὲν ἐσθὴς τὴν ἀρρυθμίαν, ἡ δὲ εὔνοια τὴν ἁμαρτίαν
περιστέλλει. There can be no doubt about the meaning of the verse in
Proverbs, ‘ love refuses to 566 faults': are we to attach the same
meaning to the quotation in St. Peter, ‘ Above all things being fervent
in your love amongst yourselves‚f0r (ὅτι) love covereth a multitude of
sins‚' where it follows a warning to ‘ be sober and watch unto prayer '2
Here love is recommended because it covers (hides) sin. This seems to
imply more than the mere shutting the eye of man to sin ε it implies
that sin, including the sin of him who loves, at least as much as that
of him who is loved,1 is thus cancelled, blotted out even in the sight
of God, Cf. Luke vii. 47 ἀφέωνται αἶ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῆς αἱ πολλαί, ὅτι
ἠγάπησεν πολύ, and above ii. 13 κατακαυχᾶται ἕλεος κρίσεως. In other
Hebrew writings we find love narrowed to ἐλεημοσύνη (⁴ pity' rather
than ‘ almsgiving ’), yet with the same promise attached to it, Sir. iii.
28 ἐλεημοσύνη ἐξιλάσεται ἁμαρτίας, Dan. iV. 24 τας ἁμαρτίας σου ἐν
ἐλεημοσύναις λύτρωσαι καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας ἐν οἷκτιρμοῖς πενήτων, Tobit iv. 10

γαρ ἀγαθόν’ εστιν ἐλεημοσύιη, ib. xii. 9 ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται καὶ
αυΤὴ ἀποκαθαίρει πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν, 01. πΟΕΟυνΤΕς ἐλεημοσύνην ΧΟρΤασθήσΟνΤαι
ζωῆς Or love' 15 nariowed to the keeping of the fifth commandment‚
as in Sir. 111. 3 0 τιμῶν πατερα εξιλάσεται ἁμαρτίας, ib. V. 14 ἐλεημοσύνη
πατρὸς οὐκ ἐπιλησθήσεται καὶ ἀντὶ ἁμαρτιῶν προσανοικδομηθήσεταί σοι ‘ pity
for a father shall not be forgotten, it shall be imputed to thee for good
against thy sins.’ Other passages in which almsgiving is referred to
as efficacious for the saving of the soul are Didache iv. 6 ἐὰν ἔχῃς διὰ

him that takes.’ A.]
