90 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

εἶναι, διὸ καὶ μηδεμίας ἀπολελεῖφθαι ἆρετῆς, ib. 120 κατὰ τὸ ἀνάλογον δὲ καὶ·
τὸν φαῦλον πάντα ὅσα ποιεῖ κακῶς ποιεῖν καὶ κατὰ πάσας τὰς κακίας, both
doctrines flowing from their conception ol' virtue 65 the art of life. In
the same way the Stoics asserted the equality of all virtues, Diog. L.
vii. 101. *We may compare St. Paul (Rom. xiv. 23) πᾶν ὃ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως
ἁμαρτία ἐστίν, and 1 Cor. X. 31 εἴτε οὖν ἐσθίετε εἴτε πίνετε εἴτε τι ποιεῖτε
πάντα εἷς δόξαν Θεοῦ ποιεῖτε.1

11. ὁ γὰρ εἰπών] The unity of the law fiows from the unity of the
law-giver (below iv. 12) 3 it is the expression of one will. The essence of
sin 1165 in disobedience to that Will however shown. It was by an
appeal to the same principle that our Lord answered the question of
the lawyer ποία ἐστὶ πρώτη πασῶν ἐντολή ‚· ‘The first of all the com-
1116111111161113515, Η661, O Israe13 the Lord our God is one Lord3 and
thou shalt love the Lord thy God ' Mark xii. 29. This spiritual view
of the law rendered impossible the comparisons of which the Jews were
so fond.

μὴ μοιχεύσῃς] Here the seventh commandment precedes the sixth, as
in Luke xviii. 20, Rom. xiii. 9, and (LXX.) Ex. XX. where the order 15
οὗ μοιχεύσεις, οὐ κλέψεις, οὗ φονεύσειςε Cf. Philo M. 2, p. 189 ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα
πεντὰς τὰς πάσας ἀπαγορεύσας περιέχει μοιχειῶν, φόνου, κλοπῆς, ψευδομαρ·
τυριῶν, ἐπιθυμιῶν, ib. p. 201 ἀπὸ μοιχείας ἄρχεται, ib. 207, 300 ἐν τῇ
δευτέρᾳ δέλτῳ πρῶτον γράμμα τοῦτ’ ἐστίν, οὐ μοιχεύσεις, Clem. Al. Strom.
vi. 816. We have the usual order in Deut. v. 17, Matt. V. 21, 27, xix.
’ 18 3 the order in Mark X. 19 varies in different MSS. The future οὗ
μοιχεύσεις 15 used by St. Matffloew, as in the LXX. 3 μή with the
subjunctive by the other Evangelists‚ as here.

εἰδὲ,οὐ μοιχεύεις, φονεύεις δὲ] For οὐ after εἶ See i. 23 οὐ ποιητής n.
Here the more exact way of expression would be μοιχεύεις μὲν οὐ,
φονεύεις δέ, the single word μοιχεύεις being negatived‚ ‘ if you commit
not adultery‚ but murder? For the omission of μέν 111 such-antitheses
See above V. 2 εἰσέλθῃ δέ and 1. 13 πειράζει δέ, also 1 Pet. 1. 8 ἄρτι μὴ
ὁρῶντες πιστεύοντες δέ, V. 12 οὐχ ἑαυτοῖς ἡμῖν δέ.

γέγονας παραβάτης νόμου] For perf. see i. 24 3 for παραβάτης above
ver. 9. On omission of article see Essay on Graminar.

12. Let your words and acts, eg. your behaviour to the poor, be
regulated by the thought that you will be judged by a law of freedom
(see i. 25), that 15, by a law of the spirit, not of the letter. It will be
a deeper-going judgment than that of man, for it will not stop short
at particular precepts or even at the outward act, whatever it may be,
but will penetrate to the temper and motive. On the other hand it
sweeps away all anxious questioning as to the exact perforinance of each
separate precept. If there has been in you the true spirit of love to God
and love to man, that 15 accepted as the real fulfilment of the law. The
same love which actuates the true Christian here actuates the -Judge
both here and hereafter, or rather He who is already dwelling in our
hearts by saith 65511165 115 of that forgiveness in our own 0656 which He
enables us to show to others.
