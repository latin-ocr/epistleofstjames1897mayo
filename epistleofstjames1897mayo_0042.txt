probabilities which are really arrayed against it. This will be
found in the note below.1

G. I proceed now to examine the E piphanian view, according to
which the Lord's brothers were sons of Joseph by a former wife.
This was the generally accepted view when Jerome put forward
his new theory, and to a great extent it escapes the difficulties
which, we have seen, attach to that theory.

Two unimportant objections made both to it and to the Helvidian
theory from the Hieronymian point of view are: (1) that they
assume the existence of two sets of cousins having two names in
common, James and Joseph being found both among the sons of
Alphaeus and among the Lord’s brothers; and if we accept the
statement of Hegesippus that Symeon was son of Clopas, and
identify Clopas with Alphaeus, we then get a third name, Symeon,
common to the families. This objection is based 011 several
assumptions, one being that Mary the wife of Clopas was sister of
the Virgin Mary, which has been shown to be all but incredible.
But waiving this, why should it be thought improbable that three
of the commonest Jewish names should be found in two sets of
cousins? We have a greater variety of Christian names in ordinary
use in England than there were then in Judea, but no one would
think such a recurrence of names in any way remarkable or extra-
ordinary; in fact, so far as my experience goes, the improbability
is all the other way.

1 Those who have followed the argument in the text will not, I think, regard the
following estimates of the chauces in favour of the several suppositions involved in
the Hieronyinian theory as giving an unfair representation of the case :

(a) for the use of ἀδελφός for cousin in the phrase ἀδελφὸς Κυρίου-0116 out of five
(1), making 4 to 1 against it.

(b) for the brethren of the Lord being included in the Twelve—one out of ten (1111),
making 9 to 1 against ic.

(c) sor the supposed sons of Clopas- Alphaeus being always found in company—
ποι with their own mother, who was certainly still living, —but with their aunt,

residing 11 1th her and 1161·’8011,ε111ι1 taking 011 themselves to control the actions ol*
the latter—one out of ten (111), making 9 to 1 against z't.

(d) for two sisters having the same name—one out of ten (11), making 9 to 1
ayaz'nst z't.

There are 1 aiious other improbabilities, some of 11111611 have been already touched
