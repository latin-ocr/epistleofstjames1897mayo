RELATION TO OTHER BOOKs OF THE Nsr. xci

But it dees not follow, as some have maintained, that becausi·
our Epistle gives no answer to St. Paul's argument addi-essm] to tln·
Romans, there is therefore no connexion between them. I think
it is impossible to read carefully the passages given below, withoui
feeling that the one writer copied from the othcr; and that, whili· ,
St. James has no reference to St. Paul, St. Paul on the contrari· ζ
writes with constant reference to St. James, sometimes borrowing
phrases or ideas, sometimes introducing a distinction for tin»
purpose of aveiding ambiguity, at other times distinctly centro-
verting his arguments as liable to be misapplied, though conscious
all the while of a general agreement in his conclusions. As
examples of borrowing, sometimes with additions and improve-
ments, I will only refer here to Rom. ii. 13, 25, V. 3, vii. 23.
xiv. 4, 22. As examples of new distinctions introduced compari·
James ii. 24 ἐξ ἕρνγων δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος καὶ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως
μόυον, with Gal. ii. 16 οὐ δικαιοῦται ἅνθρωπος ἐξ ἔργων νόμ ο υ.
ἐὰν μὴ διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

The controversia] matter must be dealt with at greater length.
The two main points at issue are (1) the necessity of work&
(2) Abraham’s justification by faith. James had said over and
over again ‘Faith without works is dead' (ii. 17, 20, 24, 26); his
meaning being (as is plain from ver. 14«, and the illustration of a
philanthropy which is limited to words (vv. 15, 16), as well as
from the whole tone and argument of the Epistle), not to depreci-
ate faith, which is with him not less than with St. Paul the very
foundation of the Christian life. (cf. i. 3, 6, ii. 1, v. 15), but to insist
that saith, like love, is valueless, if it has no effect on the life,
but expends itself in words. St. Paul himself does the same in
1 Thess. i. 3, Gal. v, 6, 1 Cor. xiii. 2, Rom. ii. 6—20, and indeed
throughout his Epistles3 but in arguing against his J udaizing
antagonists, who denied salvation to the Gentiles unless they were
circumcised and in all other respects performed ‘the works of the
1aw,’ he had maintained that it was impossible for men to be justified
by these works, and that it was by saith alone that even the Jews
and Abraham himself, no less than Gentiles, must be justified.
He therefore challenges the phrase of St. James ἡ πίστις χωρὶς
τῶν ἔρτγων ἀρὙή ἐστιν, νεκρά ἐστιν by a direct contradiction,
λογιζόμεθα νγὰρ δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς ἕρνγων νόμου,
in support of which he appeals (1) to Deut. xxvii. 26 ‘Cursed
is every one that continueth not in all things which are written
