clvi INTRODUOTION

that the Christian body included a number of rich men, who
were so indifferent to their religion as to purchase safety for them-
selves by informing against their brethren and even dragging
them before the tribunals‚ is not conceivable before the year 120
(Harnack‚ p. 485 f).

Taking the last argument first, I observe that one trait in St.
James’s description, αὐτοὶ ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια, 13 not to be
found in Hermas, and it seems very improbable that actual
members of the Church, though from cowardice (Sim. ix. 21. 3>
they might apostatize and give information against their brethren,
would themselves take the lead in dragging them before the
magistrate. I observe also that there is nothing in our epistle to
suggest that the court was Roman rather than J ewish 5 nor again
that the rich persecutors were Christians. As Dr. Plummer has
pointed out, the Holy Name was not called over them, but (ἐφ’
ὑμᾶς) over those whom they arrested. The whole passage (ii. 2-7)
is directed against the respect of persons shown in favouring the
rich at the expense of the poor ; this is illustrated by the supposi-
tion of two strangers visit-ing the synagogue, of whom nothing is
known, except that one is well dressed, the other in shabby clothes
St. J ames says their hearts should have been drawn rather to the
poor than to the rich, because the poor made up the bulk of the
Christian community, while the rich were their persecutors. If ‘we
want a parallel to the ‘ dragging before the tribunals,' we find one
ready to our hand in Acts viii. 3, where Saul, σύρων ἄνδρας καὶ
«γυναῖκας, committed them to prison. So far, I see no reason why
we should not understand the words of St.Ja1nes with reference
to the persecution of the first Christians by Jews, especially by the
rich Sadducees, as in Acts iv. 1, xiii. 50, in accordance with the
warning of our Lord (Matt. X. 17).

Ι take now the other instances of degeneracy, which, it is said,
could not have been paralleled in the Church before the time of
Hermas. The first is the warning against making God accountable
for temptation. I must say I am surprised at this being instanced
as an extraordinary example of depravity. From the time when
Adam threw the blame of his eating of the forbidden tree on ‘ the
woman whom Thou {lowest 250 be with mc' down to the present
moment, Ι should have thought this the natural and almost
inevitable excuse by which man, conscious of wrong-doing,
endeavours to palliate 1113 fault to himself. VVhether he pleads
