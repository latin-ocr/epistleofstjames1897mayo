their hope entirely in Him. If you resist him he will be
vanquished and fiee away.' On this it may be observed (1) that
the saying occurs in three other passages of Hermas (Mmccl. vii. 2,
xii. 2, 4), and that it also occurs thrice in what is probably a much
earlier treatise, the Testamenta of tha Twelve Pato’icwchs; (2) that
every text quoted by a preacher is naturally imbedded in a suitable
context, if the preacher knows his business 3 (3) that St. James’s style
is confessedly condensed and aphoristic‚ but this is no evidence of
lateness, rather the contrary; (4), that, as has been shown above in
answer to Briickner, the saying is quite in its place in our Epistle.
His other examples are James iii. 15 (the contrast of earthly and
heavenly wisdom) compared with Mancl. xi„ James i. 27 (on true
religion) compared with Ilscmzd. 17111, J ames 1. 20 (‘ the wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God ⁷) compared with Mami. v., a
passage which would have been inore appropriately compared with
James iv. 5. As to all these examples Ι an] confident that every
unprejudiced reader who takes the trouble to examine them, will
agree with me, that it would be as reasonable to say that any
modern sermon is older than its text, as to say that these comments
are older than the parallels in St. James. There is not even any
marked abruptness in the original context to excuse such extra- ·
ordinary perversity of judgment. And then the fatuity of ima-
gining that a man of such strong individuality, whose every
words attests his profound and unshakable convictions, could
condescend to borrow from one so immeasurably his inferior,
whose thoughts show about an equal mixture of cleverness and
silliness‚ and whose language, as Dr. Taylor has proved, is little
more than a patchwork of old materials, new furbished to avoid

Origen's As regards Pfleiderer's attempt to prove the lateness of our

1111311111ῗέ Epistle from the absence of patristic evidence in its favour, I

ίῗῖῗγῗὲῗῖῗιὶ must refer the reader to my second chapter, where he will find
Ep¹⁵fle' quotations enough to enable him to decide the matter for himself.
But as he has made the assei-tion that Origen expressly says

that it was not recognized as canonical (aber ccfzosclraeklzsseh cels
angyezwcifeltc Sclm'z'ft), 1 will here briefly sum up the evidence of

Origen on this point: (1) 116 never denies the genuineness of the
Epistle3 (2) he simply uses in one passage (Comm. in Jolzw. xix. 6,

L. ii. 190) the ambiguous phrase ἡ φερομένη Ἰακώβου ἐπιστολή,
