ccviii INTRODUOTION

. ἄ ν (see above under subjunctive and compound sentences) is not
used by our author with the past indicative, though this is common
enough in other books of the N.T. eg. Heb. xi. 2, 9, Gal. iv. 15,
Matt. xi. 21, or with the optative, a construction which is found
only in Luke and Acts. It is omitted with ὅστις before a sub-
junctive in ii. 10, and likewise with ἕως in v, 7. The former
construction is very rare in the N.T. but is found occasionally in
classical Greek, both verse and prose : the latter is not uncommon
in the NT. and is found in classica] poetry and in Aristotle.
Instead of ἄν we find ἐάν used with the relative in classical Greek
as well as in the N.T., see note on ὃς ἐάν iv. 4.

ε’ ν τ ε ῦ θ ε ν, pleonastic use before ἐκ τῶν ἡδονῶν iv. 1.

ἕ π ε ι τ α used, as in classical authors, after πρῶτον μέν without
an accompanying δέ 111 111. 17.

tw ο υ, used for ὅπῃ or ὅποι iii. 4⁴.

οὕτως, generally used with reference to a preceding com—
parison, as in i. 11, 11. 17, but in ii. 12 explained by what follows,
οὕτως λαλεῖτε ὡς μέλλοντες κρίνεσθαι, seemingly pleonastic in

iii. 10, where see note.
ὦ δ ε is used, as in the N.T. generally and in Theocritus and the

post-classical writers, of place,1 for the classica] ἐνταῦθα or ἐνθάδε, of
which the former is not found in the N.T. and the latter only in
Luke (including Acts) and John.
ἥ interrogative, = Latin an, implying a negative answer, iv. 5.
For «γάρ, δέ, καί, οὖν, τε, see Index.

¹ It is denied by most grammarians following Aristarchus that the local sense is
found in Homer and the earlier authors, but in many passages its use seems to
approach very near to that of our ‘hither‚’ e. g. Il. xviii. 392 Ἵ-ίφαιστε πρόμολ’ ὧδε,
Soph. Ο. Τ. 7. ὧδ’ ἐλήλυθα, and other passages quoted 111 Ellendt's Lex„ Plato Prot.
