cx INTRODUOTION

We will next consider the doctrina] basis of St. James' practica]
teaching. Man was created in the image 01 God (iii. 9), the All-
Good (i. 13, 17> ; but he has fallen into sin by yielding to his lower
impulses against his sense of right (i. 14, 15, iv. 1-3, 17), and the
natural consequence 01 510 15 death, bodily and spiritual (i. 15, V. 3, 5,
20). Not only is man 1131015 to sin3 but as a matter 01 fact we all
sin, and that frequently (111. 2). God of His free bounty has
provided a means by which we might conquer sin and 1155 to a
new life, in His word sown in our hearts (i. 18 βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύη-
σεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας, 1. 21 δέξασθε τὸν ἔμφυτον λόὙον τὸν
δυνάμενον σῶσαι τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν). 0111 salvation depends on the
way in which we receive the word (i. 21). If we have a stedfast
saith in God's goodness as revealed to us through our Lord J esus
Christ (i. 13, ii. 1, i. 5-7); if we read, mark, 15310, and inwardly
digest the word, 50 35 to make it the guiding principle 01 0111 1115,
the law of liberty by which all our words and actions are regulated
(i. 25, ii. 12), then our 501115 315 saved from death, we are made
inheritors 01 the kingdom promised to those that love God (1. 12,
25, 11. 5).

But the training by which we are prepared for this crown 01 1115
15 not pleasant to the natural man. It involves trial and endurance
(i, 2-4, 12) : it involves constant watchfulness and sels-control, and
prayer 101 heavenly wisdom, in order that we may resist the
temptations 01 the world, the fiesh and the devil (i. 26, iii. 2-8, 15,
1ν.1-5). Thus faith 15 exercised3 we are enabled to see things
as God sees them (ii. 1, 5); to 1155 above the temporal 'to the
eternal (i. 9-11) 3 to 105 not simply patient, but to rejoice in afflic-
tion (1. 2, v. 7, 8, 10, 11), and exult in the hope set before us
(1. 9-12); until at last we grow up to the full stature of a Christian
(1. 4, iii. 2), 111155 with that wisdom which comes from above, the
wisdom which is stedfast, unpretending, gentle, considerate, affec—
tionate‚ full of 11151ογ and good fruits, the parent of righteousness
and peace (111. 17, 18).

But there are many who choose the friendship of the world
instead of the friendship of God, so vexing His Holy Spirit, and
yielding themselves to the power 01 the devil; yet even then He
does not leave them to themselves, but gives more grace. He
hedges in their way in the present, and warns them of further
judgrnent to come (iv. 4-6, V. 1-8). 11 they humble themselves
under His hand and repent truly 01 their sins, He will list them
