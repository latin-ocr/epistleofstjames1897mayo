II 21—23] NOTEs 101

these commandments before the Lord our God,’ ch. xxiv. 12 foll. ‘if he
be a poor man thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun
goeth down...and it shall be righteousness (ἐλεημοσύνη) unto thee
before the Lord thy G0d‚’ Ps. cvi. 30, 31 (then stood up Phinehas and
executed jlulgment) καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην εἷς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν.
Compare also Levit. XXV. 31 αἱ δὲ οἰκίαι πρὸς τὸν ἀγρὸν λογισθήσονται
⁴ shall be reckoned as‚’ Ps. xxxii. 2 (quoted in Rom. iv. 6, 8) μακάριος
ἀνὴρ ᾧ οὗ μὴ λογίσηται Κύριος ἁμαρτίαν, YVisd. iX. 6 κᾶν γάρ τις ᾗ τέλειος
ἐν υἱοῖς ἀνθρώπων τῆς ἀπὸ σοῦ σοφίας ἀπούσης εἷς οῦδὲν λογισθήσεται,
Δικαιοσύνη 111 the Bible is taken 111 even a wider sense than that noted
by Aristotle Etle. V. 1. 15 αὕτη μὲν οὖν ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἀρετὴ μέν ἐστι τελεία,
ἀλλ’ οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἀλλὰ πρὸς ἕτερον, Wllo quotes Theognis 147 ἐν δὲ δικαιοσύνῃ
συλλήβδην πᾶσ’ ἀρετή ’στιν. In the Bible it is the character Of the man
who fulfils his duty 1n all lespects towards God, as well as towards his
neighbour. The great imp01tance of the text in Gen. XV. is that it is
the 0first passage in which the‘ law of libel ty’ is laid down. Definite
set tasks irrespective of motives are exacted from slaves· in the family
of God the motives of the children are the main thing 1n the eyes of
the Father. Here the right state of mind 13 declared to be in God’s
sight equivalent to the right action3 though, as St. James sayS,
right action is the necessary result of the right feeling and it 13 only
through right action that the right state of mind can be evidenced to
others, 30 that the absence of right action (unless precluded by special
circumstances) 13 3 proof that the state of mind 13 not right. The faith
of Abraham is the same as the trust which is 30 often declared blessed
in the Psalms, eg. Ps. ii. 12, xxxiv. S.

φίλος Θεοῦ ἐκλήθη] The precise words are not found in the LXX. In
Gen. xviii. 17, where our version simply 1133 ⁶ Shall I hide from
Abraham that thing which I <102² the LXX. has οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀπὸ Ἀβ.
τοῦ παιδός μου ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, which 13 quoted by Philo (Sobr. M. 1, p. 401)
with the words τοῦ φίλου μου, though elsewhere (Ley. All. M. 1, p. 93)
113 cites it without alteration. In 2 Chron. XX. 7 ‘Art thou not our
God who...gavest it (the land) to the seed of Abraham, thy friend, for
evel·2’, the LXX. has ἔδωκας αὐτὴν σπέρματι Ἀβραὰμ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ σου
εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα, Vulg. semini *lbraliam awzicz' tui: 133. xli. 8ί the seed of
Abraham my fliend' is in LXX. σπέρμα Ἀβρααμ ὃν ἠγάπησα.1 The
appellation is still in use among the Α1 3103, ‘with whom the name of
Khalil Allah (the friend of Gocl), 01 more briefly El Khalil, has
practically superseded that of Abraham.. Even Hebron, as the city of
Abraham, has become El Khalil' (Plumptre in loa). Clem. Rom. has
the phrase twice, probably copying from St. J ames (i. 10 ὁ φίλος
προσαγορευθείς with Lightfoot's n. and 17), and so Irenaeus iv. 16, 2
Abraham credidit Deo et ‘reputatum est illa· ad justiciam et amicus Dei
‘vocatus est. Compare John xv. 14, 15, Wisd. vii. 27 (σοφία) εἷς ψυχὰς
ὁσίας μεταβαίνουσα φίλους Θεοῦ καὶ προφήτας παρασκευάζει, Taylor⁷s J.J⁴',
p. 113, and for the same sentiment in Greek philosophers see Xen. illem..
ii. 1. 33 (virtue speaks in the allegory of Prodicus) δι’ ἐμὲ φίλοι μὲν θεοῖς
