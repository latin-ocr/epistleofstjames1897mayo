x INTRODUCTION

in loeo apparet incredulitas eornm (De Octrne Christi, 7). As Ter-
tullian in these passages gives no hint that the brothers of J esus
stood to him in any other relation than other men's brothers do to
them, or that his relationship to them was not as real as that to
his mother, so in other treatises he takes it for granted that Mary
ceased to be a virgin after the birth of Christ (De Illonoyamia 8)
Duoe nobis antistites Christiana: sanctitatis occurrant, monogamia et
continentia. Εὐ Christwln quidem viryo enioea est, semel nnptnrapost
partam (‘ being about to defer her marriage union till after the
birth of her son,' lit. ‘ being about to marry first after her delivery ²)
nt aterque titulus sanctitatis in Christi sensit dispanyeretur per
matrem ot vzffyinem et univiram ; and in even plainer words (De
Viry. Vel. 6), where he discusses the meaning of the salutation
benedicta tn inter mulieres, ‘ &Vas she called mittier, and not viryo,
because she was espoused? We need not, at any rate, suppose a
prophetie reference to her future state as a married woman ⁷ : non
enim poterat posteriorem mulierem nominare, de qua Christus nasci
non habebat, id est ‘ciram passam sect illa (illam ?) qita' orat praesens,
quoe erat viryo (‘ for the angel could not be referring to the wife
that was to he, for Christ was not to be born of a wife, i.e. of one

who had known a husband ; but he referred to her who was before

⁸ him, who was a virgin ²).
noffssfirssffive These words of Tertullian, himself stiongly ascetic, which were

ῒῇῗῗζζῗῑοῗ wlitten about the end of the second century, do not betray any

Perticiiual consciousness that he is controverting an established tradition in

ᾮξῗὲᾞῗ favour of the peipetual virginity. 0And Origen (d 253 A..,D)

,Ξῑέᾂᾞνῗζ though upholding the virginity, and objecting to the phrase used

ffssvsvssrlsslussn above by Tertullian (qnod asserant eam nupsisse post partem, unde

ᾞῗᾶῗξζξξῖξζ approbent non liabent, Comm. in Lac. 7), does not claim any authority

g'efcgss‘} for his own view, but only argues that it is admissible. Thus he -
