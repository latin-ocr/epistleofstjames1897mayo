ccxxiv INTRODUOTION

ἵνα μὴ κ ρ ι θ ἣ τ ε· ἰδοὺ ὁ κρ ι τὴ ς πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν ἕστηκεν· ὑπό-
δειΎμα λάβετε τῆς μ α κ ρ ο θ v μία ς τοὺς προφήτας· μακαρίζομεν
τοὺς ὑπομείναντας· τὴν ὑπομονὴν Ἰὼβ ἠκούσατε;
ν.17-2Ο προσευχῇ προσηύξατο τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι, καὶ
οὐκ ἔβρεξεν...καὶ πάλιν προσηύξατο...ε’άν τις πλανηθῇ
καὶ ἐπιστρέψῃ τις αὐτόν, «γινώσκετε ὅτι ὁ ἐπιστρέψας
ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ σώσει ψυχήν.

Ι have quoted all the examples of the recurrence of a word or
stem under one head for convenience sake; but it will be easily
seen that the recurrence is not always due to the same cause. It
is partly owing to the preference for short sentences, which require
the noun to be repeated for the sake of clearness3 whereas in a
complex sentence the relative pronoun or some connecting particle
might have answered the purpose. But it is plain that the
repetition is often intended to give emphasis, as in i. 19 βραδύς.
11. 6, 7 αὐτοί, 111. 6 φλογίζουσα-φλογιζομένη, 111. 7 δαμάζεται καὶ
δεδάμασται, 111. 9 ἐν αὐτῇ, iv. 1 πόθεν, iv. 12 ἀδελφός and νόμος,
v. 17 προσευχῇ προσηύξατο. It is probable however, as we may
judge from the following section, that the recurrence of the same
souncl was in itself pleasing to the writer and contributed, along
with his love of definiteness, to produce repetition, where there is
no special reason to be found in the circumstances of the case.
