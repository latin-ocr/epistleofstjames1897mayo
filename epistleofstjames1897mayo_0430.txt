150 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

think only of outer riches, your heart is set on treasure here ε that trea-
sure is perishing before your eyes : it is a witness of the perishableness
of all earthly things, including the body which makes use of it. You
yourselves are doomed to a like dec-ay, which will consume that flesh
with which you identify yourselves (Job XV. 25, 26, Psa. lxxiii. 7) no
less certainly than the funeral pyre of the Gentiles, or that which
burns to consume the garbage in the Vale of Hinnom. If you had been
willing to lose your lower life, you would have found a higher: the
corrupting body would have been nothing to the true self.' Compare
Gal. vi. 8 ⁵ he that soweth to the fiesh shall of the flesh reap corruption,’
Isa. li. 8 ‘ the moth 6111111 eat them up like a garment.' Spitta compares
Enoch xcvii. S foll. ‘Woe to you who acquire silver and gold in
unrighteousness..,they will perish together with their possessions and
111 shame will their spirits be cast into the furnace of fire‚’ Sir. xxxiv.
5 ὃ ἀγαπῶν χρυσίον οὐ δικαιωθήσεται καὶ ὃ διώκων διαφθορὰν αὐτὸς πλησθή-
σεται. May we attach to this general conception a. more special
application of the figurative 111611 It is a witness that you have not
used your wealth but selfishly stored it up (cf. Theophr. Char. X. τῶν
μικρολόγων καὶ τὰς ἀργυροθήκας ἔστιν ἰδεῖν εὖρωτιώσας καὶ κλεῖς ἰωμένοις) ;
60 06117111 neque Deus aarum destinavit (ιω-11911173 neque vestes tineis, quin
potius haee voluit 6866 hmnanac vitae subsidia. Qum-e ipsa sine usu con—
sumptio testis ipsorum inlcumsmz'tat223 erit. Auri et amenti puto-edo quasi

As the rust eats into the metal, so that selfish covetousness‚ of which
it is the sign, shall eat into your materialized soul like a canker,
destroying all the finer and more generous qualities.l For instances of
the phrase εἷς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς cf. Matt. viii. 4 ‘show thyself to the
priest as a testimony unto them‚' x.18 ‘ ye shall be brought before
kings for a witness unto them and the Gentiles? xxiv. 14, ‘the Gospel
shall be preached as a witness to all nations‚’ Luke iX. 5 ⁴ shake off the
dust of your feet' εἰς μαρτύριον ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ‘ as a witness against them ²
(in the parallel passage Mark vi. 11 the dative simply is used), Luke
ΧΧῐ. 13 ἀποβήσεται ὑμῖν εἷς μαρτύριον ‘ 113 shall turn to you for a testi-
mony ' (in your favour). There is no need to translate ὑμῖν ‘ against
you ' 3 the rust is a witness first to you and then to all observers. The
force of the future ἔσται may be thus expressed: ‘ when you come 130
inspect your treasures the rust will be a witness that you have not
used them as you ought.'

φάγεται τὰς σάρκας spem] This form of the fut. of ἐσθίω 16 Hellenistic
and is found in Luke xiV. 15 and xvii. 8 διακόνει μοι ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ, 2 Kings iX. 36 καταφάγονται αἱ κύνες
τὰς σάρκας Ἰεζάβελ, Ῑ1ον. XXVi. 29 φάγεσθε τὰς σάρκας τῶν υἱῶν, Apoc.
xvii. 16 τὰς σάρκας τῆς πόρνης φάγονται, ib. XiX. 18, 21. The form
φαγοῦμαι appears in Gen. iii. 2. Both are condemned by Phrynichus
(p. 327 Lob). Cf. σητόβρωτα above, Judith XVi. 17 Κύριος ἐκδικήσει,
αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως δοῦναι πῦρ καὶ σκώληκας εἷς σάρκας αὐτῶν, Micah
