'ohe quotation from Prov. iii. 34 given in v. 6. But ‘chere seems no
justificabion for such a sudden break 3 and we have 0131101Ί instances of
quobations in the NT. which remind us rather of the general sense of
several passages, than of ‘ohe actual words of any one particular passage*
in bhe OT. : see Alf. on 1 Cor. ii. 9 (which Jerome rightly takes as a
paraphrase of Isa. lxiv. 4, while Chrysos‘com was in doubb whether 11,
was not] from some 1051] book) 3 Eph. V. 14 probably a loose paraphrasev
from Isa. lx. 1, 2, Rom. xi. 8 made up of Isa. xxix. 10 (Alf, bun vi.
10 Jowebt) and Dent. xxix. 4 ; John vii. 38 where Westeotffs n. is ‘the
reference is not to any one isolated passage, bub to ‘ohe general tenor of
such passages as Isa. lviii. 11, Ζο011. xiv, 8 taken in connexion with the
original image (Exod. xvii. 6, Num. XX. ll) ' 3 Matt. ii. 23 (which Alf.
leaves ‘as an unsolved difficulby ') 3 and the differing versions of the
same quot-,ahion in Heb. viii. 8 f. and x. 16 f. For an account of the
various explanabions offered here, see Wolf. Cur. Phil. v. p. 58 foll„

πρὸς φθόνον ἐπιποθεῖ] ‘ J ealously desires,' cf. 1 Pet. ii. 2 (as new-born
babes) τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε, Phil. 1. 8 (God is my Wibness).
ὡς ἐπιποθῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, which Lightfoob
translates ⁴ Ι yearn affers adding ‘ the preposition in itself signifies
merely direction, but the idea of sbraining after the object being thereby
suggested, it gelas to imply eagerness, cf. Diod. xvii. 101 παρόντι μὲν οὐ
χρησάμενος, οἶπόντοι δὲ ἐπιποθήσας.’ Ηο 110131οο5 the fact that while the
simple πόθος, ποθεῖν, dvc. are 11οῢ found 111 the N.T.‚ the compounds
ἐπιποθεῖν, ἐπιποθία, ἐπιπόθησις, ἐπιπόθητος are nob uncommon. 80 111

πρὸς ὀργήν, πρὸς βίαν, πρὸς ἡδονήν, and so With δίκην, εὐσέβειαν, ὑπερβο-

ἀλήθειαν, φιλονεικίαν. We might perhaps have expected ζῆλος here
rabber than φθόνος, as we have ζηλωτής and noh φθονερός 111 Exod. XX.
