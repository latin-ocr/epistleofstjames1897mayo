cxxxiv INTRODUOTION

Here too the conclusions arrived at seem to me entirely at vari·
ance with the facts, as I think will be apparent to any one who will
ponder what has been said in my chapter on the relation of the
Epistle to Contemporary Writings. Some may be surprised to
hear that Marcion's favourite gospel is distinguished by Ebionite
leanings.1 It is true however that in some cases, not by any means
the majority, the references to the words of Christ which occur in
our Epistle approach more nearly to the form in which they are
given by St. Luke, than to the form in which they are given by
St. Matthew. The quotations in my fourth chapter will show that
it is quite a mistake to speak of section v. 17—vi. 13 in the latter,
or of the Gospel and Epistles of St. John, as affording no parallels

ν to St. J ames. Nor is it true that the Epistle betrays no knowledge

of the HebreW. Compare my note on v. 20, where the quotation
from Prov. x. 12 has no resemblance to the rendering of the LXX.

The next paragraph of Von Soden treats of the Readers for whom
the Epistle was intended. He argues that the address to the
Twelve Tribes of the Dispersion is entirely misleading, and possibly

a later insertion, as Harnack has suggested, His reasons are as
follows:

Nothing in the letter suggests Jewish readers. No reference is made to the
Temple, the worship, the Law. Instead of this, the one supreme rule of life,
by obedient-e to which man receives the blessing of salvation, is the implanted
word, which is styled the perfect law of liberty. But there is no attempt to
connect this law with the teaching of the Old Testament ; and the prescribed
Jewish ritual is not argued against, but simply ignored. It is impossible that
monotheism could have been the distinctive article of saith with J ewish
Christians: impossible that they could have magnified this saith to the de-
preciation of works. Nor could works with them ever mean works of love as
distinguished from works of the law. [Then follows the argument, already
noticed, as to the impossibility of discovering any purely Jewish church in
the Diaspora. Ι have shown above that, previous to the Council of Jerusalem,
the great majority of churches must have been of this type] Von Soden well
draws out the impossibility of the burning question, of the admission os Gen-

 

 

 

1 Apparently the only ground 1⁴01· this strange assumption is that 011 two occasions
St. Luke records our Lord's teacliing in its strong paradoxical form, without the
explanatory additions by which it is qualified elsewhere. Thus in Luke vi. 20 wc
read μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοί, but 111 Matt. v. 3 we have the addition τῷ πνεύματις 111
Luke xviii. 25 we have nothing to soften the statement ‘ lt is easier sor a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God,' but in Mark x. 24 the word ‘ rich’ is explained by ‘them that trust iu richess
But it is a mere misuse of words to characterize as Ebionism even an ascetic admi-
ration of poverty. The essence of Ebionism is of course the rejection of the divinity
of Christ, and the belief in the permanent obligation of the Jewish cercmonial,

with which was connected a high esteem for the Gospel of St. Matthew, and a strong
aversion to St. Paul's writings.
