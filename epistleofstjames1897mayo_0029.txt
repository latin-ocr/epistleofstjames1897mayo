THE A UTHOR. ix

was Bishop of Jerusalem. But Bp. Lightfoot well remarks that,
if this were meant, we must have had ἕτερος τῶν ἐκ τοῦ θείου, not
ὁ ἐκ τοῦ θείου, and that it would have been far inore natural simply
to have said ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ. The meaning of δεύτερον is made
clear from Euseb. HE. iii. 22 τῶν ἐπ’ Ἀντιοχείας Εὐοδιόυ πρώτου
καταστάντος, δεύτερος ἐν τοῖς δηλουμένοις Ἰγνάτιος ἐγνωρίζετο.
Συμεὼν ὁμοίως δεύτερος μετὰ τὸν τοῦ ,αωτῆρος ἡμῶν ἀ δ ε λ φ ὸ ν
τῆς ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐκκλησίας κατὰ τούτους τὴν λειτουργίαν
ἐγκεχειρισμένος ἣν; ib. iii. 32 ἐν ᾧ (διωγμῷ) Συμεῶνα τὸν τοῦ
Κλωπᾶ, ὃν δεύτερον καταστῆναι τῆς ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις ἐκκλησίας
ἐπίσκοπον ἐδηλώσαμεν,μαρτυρίῳ τὸν βίον ἀναλῦσαι παρειλήφαμεν.
These passages are important as showing that, while the son of
Clopas is described as the cousin of J esus, J ames is still described
as His brother: so too Jude (ib. iii. 20). The relationship is more
exactly defined in the llth ch. of the same book, where it is said
that after the death of J ames, the surviving apostles and disciples
of the Lord elected Symeon as his successor, ἀνεψιόν, ὥς γε φασί,
γεγονότα τοῦ ..,ωτῆρος· τὸν γὰρ οὖν Κλωπᾶν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ Ἰωσὴφ
ὑπάρχειν Ἡγήσιππος ἱστορεῖ.

Tertullian (d. 220 AD.) is, however, the first extant writer who
distinctly asserts that the ‘brethren ² were uterine brothers of J esus.
Arguing against Marcion, who had made use of the text, ‘ Who is
My mother, and who My brother 2' to prove that Christ was not
really man, he says: Nos contrario dicimus, primo, non potuisse illi
(annuntiari quod mater et fratres (jus foris starent . . . si nulla illi
mater et fratres nulli fuissent. . . . At vere mater et fratres ey'usforis
stabant. . . . Tum proximccspersoncis foris stare extraneis intus defixis
ad sermones ejus . . . merito indiqncitus est. Transtulit sanyuinis
nomina in alios, quos mayz's proximos pro fidejudioccrei . . . in semei
ipso docens, qui putrem aut mairem aut fraires proeponeret verbo Dei,
non esse dignum discipulum (Λᾶν. ῘΙῙαφό. iv. 19). Similarly arguing
from the same text against the Marcionite Apelles, he says ‘ the
words are not inconsistent with the truth of his humanity. No one
would have told him that his mother and his brethren stood without,
{lici non certus esset habere illum mairem ei fratres, . . . Omnes
nascimur, et tamen non omnes aut fratres habemus aut matrem.
Adhuc potest ei patrem nzayis habere quam matrem, et avunculos
magis quam fratre& . . . Fratres Domini non crediderunt in illum.
