50 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἔστω μηδὲν ἀπείρητον· αὐτόματον γὰρ οὐδέν, ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ πείρης πάντα ἆν-
θρώποισι.

In accordance with the use of ἀπείρατος Alford translates ‘ unversed
in things evil ' 3 so Hofmann (‘ Bosemfi·cmd oder vom Uebeln unbetroffen,
auf keinem Fal] aber von Bosem odeo· zu B'o‘sem unversuclzt oder unver-
suclzbm· ⁵), Briickner, Erdmann. Others (Vulg. Aeth. Luther) give it
an active sense, ⁴ God is not one who tempts to evil.' The latter
interpretation would make the next clause (πειράζει δέ) mere tautology,
and it has now no defenders. It seems to me that the case is equally
strong against the former interpretation. The meaning of the rare
word ἀπείραστος must be determined from the general force of πειράζω
111 the N.T., and especially from the following clause, which is evidently
intended to be its exact correlative in the active voice (ἀπείρασ-
τοςι πειράζει δὲ αὐτός). The relation of the two clauses would have been
more clearly marked if μὲν had been added after ἀπ.; compare for its
omission Jelf ξ 797, and below ii. 2, 11. Further it is impossible to read
this sentence without being reminded of very similar phrases used
about God by Philo and other post-Aristotelian philosophers, cf. Philo

μόνος εὐδαίμων καὶ μακάριος, πάντων μὲν ἀμέτοχος κακῶν, πλήρης δὲ ἀγαθῶν

οὐδεμίαν ἐν ἑαυτῷ αἰτίαν ἔχει τοῦ κακοποιεῖν· κακίαν γὰρ οὐκ ἔχει, οὐδέ τι κακῶς
ποιεῖ, see Gataker⁷s note there and on ii. 11, Sext. Emp. Mam. ix. 91 τὸ

fecit. The original source seems to be the maxim of Epicurus, Diog. L.
Χ. 138 τὸ μακάριον καὶ ἄφθαρτον οὔτε αὐτὸ πράγματα ἔχει οὔτε ἄλλῳ παρέχει,
which is compared here by Oecumenius 3 see my note on Cic. N.D. i. 45.
For the gen. κακῶν, which is perhaps more easily explained as meaning ‘to
evil ' than ‘ by evil,' see Xen. Cyrop. iii. 3. 55 ἀπαίδευτος ἀρετῆς, Ἧ11161,
p. 242, who compares 2 Pet. ii. 14 καρδίαν γεγυμνασμένην πλεονεξίας,
Soph. Ant. 848 ἄκλαυτος φίλων. Ι think these are best classed under
the head of ‘Genitive of the Sphere,' an extension of the Inclusive
(‘ Partitive’) genitive, ‘untemptable in regard of evil things,' just
as it might be said of one who was wholly evil that he was
ἀπείραστος ἀγαθῶν.1 We have still to consider an objection drawn from
the context : ⁶ there is no question here of God being tempted, but of
God tempting,’ Alf. This is sufficiently met by the passages cited
above from Philo, Plutarch, and Antoninus ε God is incapable of
tempting others to evil, because He is Himself absolutely insusceptible
to evil ; i.e. our belief in God's own character, His perfect purity and

1 Von Soden destroys the sense of the passage by taking κακῶν of afflietious. It is
of course used of moral evil, as in Rom. i. 30, 1 Cor. x. 6.
