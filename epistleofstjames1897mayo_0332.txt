52 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

relation between 1116 two words has been Wrongly illustrated from
Herod. ii. 71) ἐπεὰν νῶτον ὑὸς δελεάσῃ περὶ ἄγκιστρον. . ,ὃ κροκόδειλος ἐντυχὼν
τῷ νώτῳ καταπίνει, οἱ δὲ ἕλκουσιν· ἐπεὰν δὲ ἐξελκυσθῇ ἐς γῆν κ.τ.λ. This
would make 6 ὕστερον πρότερον 111 0111 text, where the drawing is
previous to the actual catching at the particular bait. Heisen cites a
number of lines of Oppian in which ἕλκω and its compounds are used,
as 11616, of the first drawing of the fish out fron] its original retreat, eg.
iii. 316 the balb ἐφέλκεται ἰχθύας εἵσω, iv. 3593 Cf. Xen. Cyrop. viii.
1. 22 ἐγκράτειαν οὕτω μάλιστ’ ἂν ᾤετο ἀσκεῖσθαι εἷ αὐτὸς ἐπιδεικνύοι ἑαυτὸν
μὴ ὑπὸ τῶν παραυτίκα ἡδονῶν ἑλκόμενον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαθῶν, ib. illem. iii. 11. 18.
In like manner the first effect of ἐπιθυμία 13 to draw the man out of
his original repose, the second to 6111116 111111 10 a definite bait. Heisen
illustrates this from the temptation of Eve, first moved from her
secure trust in God by the words of the 161119161- (Gen. iii. 1—5), then
attracted by the fruit itself (V. 6)st Another way of distinguishing
between the two words is to suppose that ἐξέλκω implies the violence,
δελ. 1116 01161111 of passion, as in Philo M. 2, p. 470 πρὸς ἐπιθυμίας
ἐλαύνεταὶ ἢ ὑφ’ ἡδονῆς δελεάζεται, ‘driven by passion or solicited by
pleasure,' but Ι prefer the former explanation. Spitta, comparing iv.
7, makes ὃ διάβολος 1116 subject of ἐξέλκειν and thinks this word
contains 611 allusion 10 Gen. iv. 7 ‘ if thou doest not well, sin coucheth
at the door! where however the Greek has no resemblance to the
Hebrew. It is much simpler to understand the participles as
describing the manner of temptation by the ἐπιθυμία.

15. συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν,] For the metaphor cf. Psa. vii. 14
ὠδίνησεν ἀδικίαν, συνέλαβε πόνον καὶ ἔτεκεν ἀνομίαν, Philo M. 1. 40 οἷα
ἓταιρὶς καὶ μάχλος οὖσα ἡδονὴ γλίχεται τυχεῖν ἐραστοῦ, ib. 149 ὅταν ὃ ἐν ἡμῖν
νοῦς-κεκλήσθω δὲ Ἀδάμ-ἐντυχὼν αἰσθήσει-καλεῖται δὲ Εὕα-συνουσίας
ὀρεχθεὶς πλησιάσῃ, ἥδε συλλαμβάνει...ἐγκύμων τε γίνεται καὶ εὐθυς ὠδῖνει
καὶ τίκτει κακῶν ψυχῆς τὸ μέγιστον, οἴησιν, ib. 183 ὥσπερ ταῖς γυναιξὶ πρὸς
ζώων γένεσιν οἰκειότατον μέρος ἡ φύσις ἔδωκε μήτραν, οὕτω πρὸς γένεσιν
πραγμάτων ὥρισεν ἐν ψυχῇ δύναμιν, δι’ ἧς κυοφορεῖ καὶ ὠδίνει καὶ ἀποτίκτει
πολλὰ διάνοια· τῶν δὲ ἀποκυομένων νοημάτων τὰ μὲν ἄῤῥενα, τὰ δὲ θηλέα,
Justin M. Trypho 327 (Ἷκ παρθένος οὖσα Εὕα τὸν λόγον τὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄφεος
συλλαβοῦσα παρακοὴν καὶ θάνατον ἔτεκε, and in Classical Writers Theognis
153 τίκτει γὰρ κόρος ὕβριν, and Aesch. Αῃ. 727 foll. Sin is the result of
the surrender of the will 10 1116 soliciting of ἐπιθυμία instead of the
guidance o'f reason. In itself, ἐπιθυμία may be natural and innocent:
it 13 when the man resolves to gratify it against what he feels to be
the higher law of duty, that 116 becomes guilty of sin even before he
carries 0111 1113 resolve in act. Spitta thinks that here, as in the

1 The two examples cited for this use of ἐξέλκειν by one commentator after another
are somewhat doubtful. Arist. Pol. v. 10. 1311, b. 30 παρὰ τῆς ’γυναικὸς ἐξελκυσθεῖς
might mean ‘lured away from the side of his wife,' but hardly αῖ) umore sollicitatus
(Alf.); and that which Alford calls ‘the nearest correspondenoe of all, Plut. de sera
mwninis vindicta τὸ ’γλυκὺ τῆς ἐπιθυμὶας ὥσπερ δέλεαρ ἐξέλκειν,’ Ι have searched for
in vain in the treatisc referred to, and it 13 not to be found 111 WVyttenbach’s Index.
It is, I presunie, a nlisqiiota1i011 for thc words which do occur in that treatise (p. 554
E) ἔχεται ἕκαστος ἀδικήσας τῇ δίκῃ, καὶ τὸ ’γλυκὺ τῆς ἀδικίας ὥσπερ δέλεαρ εὐθὺς ἐξεδή-
δοκε, τὸ δὲ συνειδὸς ἐγκείμενον ἔχων κ.τ.λ.
