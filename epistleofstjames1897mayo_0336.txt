56 THE EPISTLE OF ST. J AMES

ὑποχωρῶν ἐν τοῖς ἐρήμοις, V. 17, ἦν διδάσκων. For this extension of the
periphrastic tense, itself merely an instance of the analytic tendency
which marks the later stage of language, see WViner, p. 437, A. Butt-
mann, p. 264 foll„ where many cases are given3 Arist. Met. iv. 7 οὐδὲν·
διαφέρει τὸ ἅνθρωπος βαδίζων ἐστὶν τοῦ ἄνθρωπος βαδίζει. On the whole
I think the rhythm and balance of the sentence is better preserved by
separating ἐστι from καταβαῖνον. The construction will then be the same
as is found in John viii. 23 ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐκ τῶν ἅνω εἶμί, and
implied below iii. 17 ἡ δὲ ἄνωθεν σοφία ἁγνή ἐστιν. For ἄνωθεν ef. John
3. 31, where it is equivalent to ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ immediately afterwards
Xen. Symp. Vi. 7 (οἱ θεοὶ) ἄνωθεν μὲν ὕοντες ὠφελοῦσιν, ἄνωθεν δὲ φῶς
παρέχουσιν, Philo M. l, p. 645 Ἰσαὰκ διὰ τὰς ὀμβρηθείσας ἄνωθεν δωρεὰς
ἀγαθὸς καὶ τέλειος ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐγένετο.

καταβαῖνον ἀπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς τῶν ᾠώτων.] Explains ἄνωθεν, just as ἐκ τῶν·
ἡδονῶν explains ἐντεῦθεν in iv. 1 below, The comparison of God to the-
sun, and of his influence to light, is found both in Jewish and in
classical Writers: for (1) see Malachi iv. 2 ἀνατελεῖ ὑμῖν τοῖς φοβουμένοις
τὸ ὄνομά μου ἥλιος δικαιοσύνης, Psa. XXXV. 9, Isa, lX. 1, 19, 20, 1 John
i. 5, Apoo. xxi. 23, Wisd. vii. 16 (σοφία) ἀπαύγασμά ἐστι φωτὸς ἀϊδίου,
ib. V. 29 ἐστὶν γὰρ αὕτη εὐπρεπεστέρα ἡλίου καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν ἄστρων θέσιν,
φωτὶ συγκρινομένη εὑρίσκεται προτέρα· τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ διαδέχεται νύξ, σοφίας δὲ
οὐκ ἀντισχύει κακία, Philo M. 1. p. 637 πρὶν τὰς τοῦ μεγίστου καὶ ἐπιφα-
νεστάτου Θεοῦ καταδῦναι περιλαμπεστάτας αὐγάς, ἃς δι1 ἔλεον τοῦ γένους.
ἡμῶν εἷς νοῦν τὸν ἀνθρώπινον οὐρανόθεν ἀποστέλλει κ.τ.λ., ib. M. 1, p. 579
πηγὴ τῆς καθαρωτάτης αὐγῆς Θεός ἐστιν, ὥστε ὅταν ἐπιφαίνηται ψυχῇ, τὰς
ἀσκίους καὶ περιφανεστάτας ἀκτῖνας ἀνίσχει, ib. p. 7 ἔστιν (ὁ θεῖος λόγος)
ὓπερουράνιος ἀστὴρ, πηγὴ τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἀστέρων. (2) The chief passage
in a Classical author is the elaborate comparison between the sun and
the ἰδέα τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ in Plato Rep. vi· 505 foll„ and especially vii. 517
πᾶσι πάντων αὕτη ὀρθῶν τε καὶ καλῶν αἰτία. ”

For the word πατήρ compare Eph. i. 17 ὁ πατὴρ τῆς δόξης, 2 Cor. i. 3¹
ὁ πατὴρ τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν, Job XXXViii. 28 πατὴρ ὑετοῦ, John viii. 44, Philo!
M. Lip. 631 μὴ θαυμάσῃς εἰ ὃ ἥλιος κατὰ τοὺς ἀλληγορίας κανόνας ἐξομοιοῦ-
ται τῷ πατρὶ καὶ ἡγεμόνι τῶν συμπάντων κ.τ.λ., and a little below (after
citing Psa. xxvii. 1 Κύριος φῶς μου) οὗ μόνον φῶς ἀλλὰ καὶ παντὸς ἑτέρου
φωτὸς ἀρχέτυπον, μᾶλλον δὲ ἀρχετύπου πρεσβύτερον καὶ ἀνώτερον, ὦ. M,
2. p. 254 ὃ Θεὸς καὶ νόμων ἐστὶ παράδειγμα ἀρχέτυπον καὶ ἡλίου ἥλιος,
νοητὸς αἰσθητοῦ, παρέχων ἐκ τῶν ἀοράτων πηγῶν ὁρατὰ φέγγη τῷ βλεπομένῳ.
Philo constantly uses the phrase ὁ πατὴρ τῶν ὅλων for the Creator.

τῶν spem-mm] Refers in the first place to the heavenly bodies (Gen.
i. 3, 14—18, Psa. cxxxv. 7, Jer. xxxi 35, Sir. xliii. 142), which were·
by the Jews identified with the angels or hosts of God (cf. J ob xxviii.
7, where they are expressly called ‘sons of God,’ Is. xiv. 12. foll. of
Lucifer, and the benediction before Shema, ‘ Blessed be the Lord our
God who hath formed the lightsj quoted by E(lersliei1n15*k·etclzes of Jewish
Life p. 269) 31 but secondly to intellectual and spiritual light, which is

¹ Philo speaks of the stau-s as ζῷα νοεροί M. 1. p. 17. It 151 perhaps a slight con-
firmation of the idea that St. James had at one time been influeneed by the Essenes,
that the latter are said to have paid special reverence to the sun 3 compare Philo Vz‘t..
