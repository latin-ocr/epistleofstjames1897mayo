ON THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES cxcvii

νγλῶσσαν οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται followed by ἀκατάστατον κακόν,
μεστὴ ιὀῦ, which we 0311 here explain as a new sentence with the
subject ἡ «γλῶσσά ἐστιν understood ; but such an explanation fails
in Apoc. iii. 12 «γράψω ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς καινῆς Ἱερουσαλήμ,
ἡ καταβαίνουσα ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα μου τὸ καινόν,
and in other passages referred to in my note. We have however
many examples of the ordinary apposition, as in the nom. i. 1
Ἰάκωβος δοῦλος, ver. 8 ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος...ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, 11. 21
Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν, 11. 25 “Ραὰβ ἡ πόρνη, 1. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ
αὕτη ἐστίν, ἐπι-σκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανούς, where αὕτη is in apposition
to the following infinitive ; in the gen. i. 1 Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ,
and the harsh use in ii. 2 τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ
Χριστοῦ, τῆς δόξης, where see note, in the 300. ii. 21 Ἰσαὰκ τὸν
υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, not to mention such cases as i. 1 ταῖς δώδεκα φυλαῖς
ταῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ, iii. 6 ἡ «γλῶσσα ἡ σπιλοῦσα, V. 4⁴ ὁ μισθὸς ὁ
ἀφυστερημένος, which are treated of under the article.

κατά el), iii. 9 καταρώμεθα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους (for cl. dat), v, 6
κατεδικάσατε τὸν δίκαιον (for cl. gen), v. 12 μὴ ὀμνύετε τὸν
οὐρανόν (so in elassieal writers, who also use κατά e. [son. as in

Heb. vi. 13, but never εἰς 01 ἐν, as in Matt. v. 34, 35).
Of Dimalion, v. 17 οὐκ ἔβρεξεν ἐνιαυτοὺς τρεῖς.

Αάυονῦίίιί (defining the extent of the aetion), 1. 6 μηδὲν διακρι-
νόμενος, iii. 2 πολλὰ, πταίειν.
