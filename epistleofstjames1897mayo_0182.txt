clxii INTRODUOTION

Andrews and Laud, of the ‘Latitude men' of the same century,
on the ground that we find history repeating 115611ι in the Low
Churchmen, the Tractarians and the Broad Ohurchmen of the
19th century. How far more philosophica] was the view of
Thucydides when he magnified the importance of the 16550115 of
history, because ‘the future will surely, after the course of human
things, reproduce, if not the very image, yet the near resemblance
of the pastl' There is nothing against which the historical
inquiret should be more on his guard than any α priori assumption
in determining such a question as this: Is the character, are the
contents, of the Epistle of St. 5611165 601151516111 with what we
know of the pre-Pauline Church, of the teaching of Christ, and of
contemporary J ewish opinion? Ι 1161111116 10 think there is a 601-
respondence so exact that, given the one side, it would have been
possible to infer the other side. We will test this in the 6656 of*
Faith and VVorks. Faith is with St. J ames the essential condition
of effectual prayer (i. 6, v, 15), it is the essence of religion itself,
so that Christianity is described as ‘the saith of our Lord Jesus
Christ' (ii. 1); the trials os life are to prove saith (i. 3); those
who are rich in saith are 116115 of the kingdom (ii. 5). 51151 50 111
1116 Gospels: Christians are those who believe in Christ (Matt.
xviii. 63 Mark ix. 42); saith in God is the condition of prayer;
‘all things are possible to him that believeth' (Mark ix. 23);
‘whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye have
received them, and ye shall have them' (Mark xi, 24) ; ‘ He did
not many mighty works there because of their unbelief' (Matt.
xiii. 58), ‘thy saith hath saved thee' (Mark v. 34). But faith,
which comes from hearing, must be proved, not by words, but by
deeds, if it is to produce its effect (Jas. i. 22, 25, 263 ii. 14-26).
So in the Gospels: ‘By their fruits ye shall know them,’ ‘ Who-
soever heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them, I will liken
him to a wise man' (Matt. vii. 20, 24), ‘The Son os Man shall come
in the glory of His Father, and then He shall reward every man
according to his works ² (Matt. xvi. 27). The relation of faith and
works as shown in 5611165 11. 22, ‘Faith wrought with his works,
and by works was his saith made perfect‚' agrees with the image
of ‘ fruits ' used in Matthew vii. 20, xii. 33, and with the language
of 4. Ezra, ‘one of the very few Jewish writings which can be
attributed with any confidence to the Apostolic age,' 1 cf. vii. 34 ;
