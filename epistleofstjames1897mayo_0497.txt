III 13-18 WISDOM 217

Epistles and elsewhere, the counterparts of the Jewish rabbis, men
fluent and positive and argumentative, who arrogated to themselves
the name of wise. St. James says nothing as to the extent of their
learning or knowledge 3 he is content to point out those particular
characteristics of heavenly wisdom in which they were manifestly
deficient. We cannot argue from this that he would have disapproved
of elaborate disquisitions on theologieal questions such as we read in
the Epistle to the Hebrews, or that he would have condemned the
pursuit of learning or sciense for its own sake 3 but for the present his
mind is fixed on practical issues.

IV. 1—17. Paraphrase.

The reat sonrce of our quarrelsomeness is the yrcectiness with which
each one qrasps at pleasnre for himself. We are envioas, if we sec
others sacceed where we have failed .· and wc are consciens that our
wlwte life is a faitare, as it always must be, when rnen either omit to
pray, or prag] only for worldty objects whcreby to ,qratify their setfish
thpzalses. But those who sech the world's favour can never obtain the
favour of eod. The two are absolutely incompatibte. As the Scrip-
tnre says, ‘the Spirit which He has planted in its jealonsly Zonys for
our lore! It is owing) to this jeatoas affection that He resists the
prend and gives ⁸qrace to the hnmbte. I f we snbmissivety accept His
chastisement anot return to Hirn, He wilt return to us, anot the tempter,
who offers the world to each of its, as he (tid to Christ, wilt flee from
us also, when he finds wc are determined to resist him. This we must
’ cto by renovant-inq alt wiched actions and chechiny att evit thonyhts, by
learniny to take a serious view of life, giving] up onr thonqhtlcss
nzirth, practisiny sels-deniat and repentance, nzourninq over sin and
hamblinq oursctves before God. If we thus tarn from the world to
GocZ, He wilt raisc ns up and gyrant us a share in His hinydom.

Do not think tiyhtty os itt—natared yossip. To speak ayainst a
brother or to condemn a brother is really to speah' ayainst and con-
demn the law os God, who has bictcten ns to love one another, and has
‘qii'en a special warning] ayainst this sin in the wordS, ‘Judye not,
that yse bc not jactem? Shatt we venture to set up our opinion ayainst
God’s law, anst claim to do that which has been ctistinetlgs forbidden
by the sote Lawyiver ancl Judqe? Oar duty is not to crinem, but
to obey.

Α further characteristic of the spirit of worldliness is exhibitect in
our confident forming] of plans for the sature, without any thonfsht
of the precarious nature of earthtgs enybyment, and of oar dependence
