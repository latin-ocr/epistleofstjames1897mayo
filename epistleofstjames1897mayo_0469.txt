of his wrong-doing on God, who made him what he is, and placed him
in circumstances which it was impossible to contend against. St.
James meets this in two ways: (1) by showing that it involves 6 sup-
position whichscontradicts what we know of God, (2) by explaining
more fully the nature of internal temptation. (1) (α) God is untemp-
able 3 (b) He tempts 110116. But how are these statements to be 166011-
6116(1 with other passages of Scripture, in which God is said both to be
tempted and to tempt? Such are Ex. xvii. 2 ‘why do ye tempt (πειρά-
ζετε) the Lord 2' ver. 7 ‘ he called the name of the place Massah (πειρασ-
μόν) because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us or
not‘l' Numbers xiv. 22, Deut. vi. 16 ‘ye shall not tempt 1116 Lord,'
Ps. lxxviii. 18, 41, xcv. 9, Isa. vii. 12, Matt. iv. 7 (where our Lord
meets the temptation to cast himself down from the temple by referring
to the command in Deut. vi. 16), Acts v. 9 (of Ananias and sapphira)
‘how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the
LordZ' 1 Cor. X. 9 ‘neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also
tempted and were destroyed of serpents ² (referring to Numb. xxi. 5
⁶ the people spake against God and against Moses, XVherefore have ye
brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness 2 ²), cf. Judith viii.
12 (of the rash oath of Ozias to surrender Bethulia if help did not come
within five days) ‘ who are ye that have tempted God? . . . ye cannot
find out the depth of the heart of man, then how can ye search out
God or comprehend his purpose 2 . . . He hath power to defend us when
he will. Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God.' So 5611-
sought martyrdom and the 91090561 10 1651 1116 power of prayer by
comparing the results in a praying and in a non-praying hospital may
in different ways be regarded as tempting God. The distinction is
plain between the temptation to sin of which St. James speaks and
such cases as these, in which men are said to tempt God, when they
make experiments with Him, or take liberties with Him, try how far
they may gO, so 1ο speak, instead of humbly submitting 10 what they
feel to be His revealed will or His providential ordering 3 when in the
words of Stier they ‘ anticipate by the word of their own self-will the
word of God upon which they should wait.' Man 6611 be tempted
because of the propensity to evil in his own nature 3 God cannot be
tempted because He is absolute goodness.

But (b) we also read of God tempting man, as where He tested
Abraham's obedience by demanding the sacrifice of his 5011 (Gen. xxii.
1), 01· the Israelites by the forty years' wandering ‘ 10 humble thee,
and 10 prove thee (πειράσῃ), 10 know what was in thine heart,' Deut.
viii. 2, or Hezekiah by the Babylonian embassy 2 Chron. xxxii. 31, cf.
J udith viii. 25-27. But here again the design of temptation is quite
different from that spoken of in the text 3 11 15 1101 temptation with
the view of drawing men into sin, but trial with the view of dis-
covering his motives and principles and of gradually building up 1116
perfect Christian character, as stated in the second verse.

(2) What then is the real history of the temptation which allures
us to sin? It has its root in man himself, in his appetites, desires
and impulses of every sort, suggesting the thought of pleasure to
