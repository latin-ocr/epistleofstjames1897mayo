76 THE EPISTLE OF sT. JAMEs

hold the faith Γ dxc· The interrogative rendering is also preferred by
Stier‚ Schneckenburger, Kern, Gebser‚ Pott, and other commentators.
I think it is simpler and more natural to take ἔχετε as imperative,
especially as it is the commencement of a new section of the epistle,
and it is the manner of the writer to begin by putting each topic
forward clearly and explicitly, usually in the shape of a precept,
and afterwards to enforce and illustrate it in a variety of forms.
It certainly cannot be said that, taken interrogatively, the sentence
gives a clear, unmistakable meaning. At first sight it would
seem to suggest that those addressed are not guilty of respect of
persons. And the following γάρ, which, if we take ἔχετε as impera-
tive, gives a warning against respect of persons, because it is
shown by an example to involve worlclly-mindedness and unrighteous
judgment, is hard to explain if we take ἔχετε as a question : (‘ Can it
be that you are guilty of partiality2 For if you make distinctions in
your religious meetings you are not whole-hearted‚ but led away by
worldly considerations.') The imperative also suits better the serious-
ness of the writer and the opening words ἀδελφοί μου. For ἐν express-
ing the sphere of manifestation cf. above i. 21 ἐν πραΰτητι, 1 Tim. i.
18 ἵνα στρατεύῃ ἐν αὐταῖς τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν. Μὴ ἔχετε is a more
personal way of putting μὴ ἔστω ἡ πίστις, implying free-will and
responsibility‚ cf. hIark iX. 50 ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλας, Rom. X. 2 ζῆλον

τῆς ὃόξης.] This genitive has been variously interpreted as having an
objectiva a subjective, or a qualitative force, and been connected in
turn by different commentators with every substantive in the sentence:
with προσπολημψίαις (1) by Erasmus, Calvin, Heisen, Michaelis 3
with πίστιν (2) by the Peshitto, Grotius, Cornelius a Lapide, Hammond
and Hofmann3 with the whole or a portion of the phrase τοῦ Κυρίου
...Χριστοῦ (3) by the majority of commentators. 1. Erasmus trans-
lates ‘ Cum partium studio quo ex sua quisque opinione quemlibet
aestimat ' ; Calvin, ‘ Ne in acceptionibus personarum fidem habeatis...eae
opinioozef which he explains ‘Nam dum opum vel honorum opinio
nostros oculos perstriwyit, veritas supprimitur) Both interpretations
would make δόξης a subjective genitive, denoting the cause or source of
προσωπολημψία, Michaelis, on the other hand, gives it an objective
force, translating ‘sidonio-atio hominum secmzdmn externum splendo-
rem’ 3 and much in the same way, Heisen. It is now generally recog-
nised that the order of the words renders this explanation of the
construction impossible. 2. The Peshitto, followed by Grotius, Ham-
mond‚ Hofmann, «ἕω, translates ‘saith of (in) the glory of Christ’
(objective genitive). Huther, ‘ Christ-given saith in the glory to be
revealed'3 Gataker, followed by Hottoman, ‘the glorious faith in
