THE OATHOLIO EPISTLES cclix

THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES.

THOUGH the word καθολική does not form part of the Title of
the Epistle of 81. James in any of the older MSS„ yet the fact
that this Epistle was included from an early period in the collec-
tion known as the Catholic Epistles, which followed the Acts and
preceded the Epistles of 81. Paul, seems to call for a short note on
the history and meaning of the term.

Eusebius is the first to mention the fact in the words τοιαῦτα
τὰ κατὰ τὸν Ἰάκωβον, οὗ ἡ πρώτη τῶν ὀνομαζομένων καθολικῶν
ἐπιστολῶν εἶναι λέγεται (ΗΕ. ii. 23), and we find the same
asserted in the Catalogues of the Canonical Books ratified by the
Councils of Laodicea and of Carthage, as well as in the lists given
by Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, and Am-
philochius before the end of the fourth century.l Earlier uses of
the term may be found in Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iv. 15,
p. (505 P), where, in speaking of 1116 Epistle put forth by the
Apostolic Council recorded in Acts XV„ 116 says κατὰ τὴν ἐπιστο-
λὴν τὴν καθολικὴν τῶν ἀποστόλων ἁπάντων; and in Origen‚ with
reference to 1116 Epistle of Barnabas (ο. Cela i. 63) «γέγραπται ἐν
τῇ Βαρνάβα καθολικῇ ἐπιστολῇ, as well as 10 1116 Epistles of 81.
John, St. Peter, and 81. J ude.2 Apollonius (c. 210 A.D.) reproached
Themison the Montanist with writing a catholic epistle in imita-
tion of the Apostle (81. J 01111).3

The meaning of the term 15 111115 stated by Oecumenius in his
Preface 10 our Epistle: καθολικαὶ λέγονται αὗται οἱονεὶ ἐγκύκ-
λιοι· οὐ ’γὰρ ἀφωρισμένως ἔθνει ἑνὶ ἢ πόλει, ὡς ὀ θεῖος Παῦλος
τοῖς ίΡωμαιόις ἦ Κορινθίοις προσ-φωνεῖ ταύτας τὰς ἐπιστολὰς ὁ
τῶν τοιούτων τοῦ Κυρίου μαθητῶν θιάσος, ἀλλὰ καθόλου τοῖς
πιστοῖς ἤτοι Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ διασπορᾷ, ὡς καὶ ὁ Πέτρος, ἢ
καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ὑπὸ τὴν αὐτὴν πίστιν Χριστιανοῖς τελοῦσιν. Thus
understood, the term is not properly applicable 10 1116 21111 and
