V 16, 17] NOTEs 173

passive meaning is not only possible but in every case superior to the
middle 3 and Dr. Hort in a private letter takes the same view of our
text and of Gal. v. 6 without giving an opinion as to the other examples.
Those who attribute the middle sense to St. Paul may illustrate the
relations of the active to the middle by the analogy of τιθέναι and
τίθεσθαι νόμον. God acting by his own sovereign will ἐνεργεῖ, the
principle of good which he engrafts into our nature ἐνεργεῖται. But
whatever may be our judgment about St. Paul's usage, there is no
reason to suppose that St. James would have departed from what
appears to have been the uniform custom of all other writers.

I turn now to the explanations offered by previous editors. The
old Greek commentators give it a passive sense, Oecumenius and
Theophylact interpreting it much as Matthaei’s scholiast συνεργουμένη
ὑπὸ τῆς Ι’τοῦ δεομένου γνώμης καὶ πράξεως ‘assis-ted by (actualized by)
the intention and the action of the sick man‚' and not far otherwise
Euthymius and Cramer's Catena ‘ strengthened and heartened by the
penitence and obedience of the sick‚' which they illustrate by the
case of Samuel forbidden to pray for Saul, of Jeremiah forbidden to
pray for the Jews. They also give a second interpretation, according
to which the just man’s prayer is energized by his own life of active
godliness (τὴν δέησιν ἕνεργον καὶ ζῶσαν τοῖς τρόποις τῶν ἐντολῶν ψυχουμένην
...ἰσχυρὰν καὶ πάντα δυναμένην ὁ δίκαιος ἔχει τὴν δέησιν ἐνεργουμένην ταῖς
ἐντολαῖς) : cf. Theodoret’s note on the next verse ταῦτα τοῦ θείου πνεύ-
ματος ἐνεργοῦντος εἴρηκεν ὃ προφήτης in the same Calena. Michaelis
takes it in the way suggested above preces aqitcmte Spiritu effusae. De
NVette, Hoffmann, Huther, Alford take it ‘the prayer of a righteous
man avails much in its working,’ but this gives a very poor force to a
word which ought from its position to be emphatic. Erdmann trans-
lates ‘ viel vermag das Gebet (les Gerechten indem es sich wirksam
erweist‚’ which appears to me either tautological or unmeaning : prayer
is no prayer at all, if it is not real. Bp. VVordsworth seems to strain
the force of the preposition (which cannot be other in the verb than in
adj. ἕνεργος, from which it is derived) when he translates ‘working
inwardly‚⁷ ‘inwardly energizing in devotion ancl love, so as to pro-
duce external effects in obedience.' Most commentators take it with
Luther ‘wenn es ernstlich ist' (so Dean Scott ‘when urgent,' he
compares Col. iv. 12 πάντοτε ἀγωνιζόμενος ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς) 3
though some ignore the participial force and make it simply equivalent
to ἐνεργής (Heb. iv. 12, Philem. 6) or ἐκτενής (Luke xxii. 44, Acts xii.
5), as Schneckenburger‚ Kern, Bouman, VViesinger. This makes fair
sense3 but, as we have seen, there is no ground for supposing that
ἐνεργουμένη may be used in the sense of ἐνεργὴς οὖσα. Pallad. Laus.
1083 B and Eustath. on Odyss. δ. p. 197, 50 are cited for the phrase
προσευχὴ ἐνεργής. Lange tries to combine the force of the passive and
middle, ⁴ die mit der vollen Hingebung an den gottlichen Impuls
zugleich gesetzt volle Spannung des betenden Geistes.’

in ver. 15 may have suggested the thought of the prophet who raised
