the will of God. The right feeling is, both my life and my actions
are deterniined by Him. To put ζήσομεν or ζήσωμεν into the pro—
tasis is to make life independent of God’s will, a second factor which
needs to be taken into account.

ἑν ταῖς dubietais-J] Does not denote the subject of glorying like ἐν
τῷ ὕψει i. 9, but the manner in which glorying was shown, ‘in your
sels-confident speeches or imaginations' = ἀλαζονευόμενοι, cf, Clem.
Rom. 2l ἀνθρώποις ἐγκαυχωμένοις ἐν ἀλαζονείᾳ τοῦ λόγου αὐτῶν. In N.T.
only found here and 1 John ii. 16 ἡ ἁλαζόνεια τοῦ βίου. The adj. is
also found twice, each time joined with ὑπερήφανος, see above ver. 6.
Aristotle defines ib ΕἰῘι. Ν. iV. 7. 2 δοκεῖ ὃ ἀλαζὼν προσποιητικὸς τῶν
ἐνδόξων εἶναι καὶ μὴ ὑπαρχόντων καὶ μειζόνων ἢ ὑπάρχει, see Tl’enCh ›S‘jstu
p. 113 foll. Here it implies confidence in one's cleverness, luck‚ strength,
skill, 21⁷0„ unfounded in so far as the future result is not dependent on
them, but not necessarily unfounded in regard to the actual possession
of these qualitieS, cf. Test. Joseph. 17 οὐχ ὕψωσα ἐμαυτὸν ἐν ἀλαζονείᾳ
διὰ τὴν κοσμικὴν δόξαν μου, ἀλλ7 ἤμην ἐν αὐτοῖς ὡς εἷς τῶν ἐλαχίστων, So
Job xxviii. 8 υἱοὶ ἀλαζόνων represents the Heb. ‘children of pride'
(‘lion's whelps' in A.V.). For the plural see above ii. 1 προσωπολημ-
ψίαις; Bengel says arrogantiae eaeprz'muntm· in illis veo-bis, profisciscemur,
lucrabimur ,· 9Zoriatz'0 in praesmnptione tempori&

τοιαύτη.] ‘ Every such boasting,’ because there may be a good καύ-
χησις, as in i. 9 ; Of. 1 Cor. V. 6 οὐ καλὸν τὸ καύχημα ὑμῶν.

17, εἰδότι osum] ‘So then, if one knows to do good and (1005 it not,
there is guilt to him.’ The verse contains a general summing up ancl
moral of what has been said before, going back as far as 1. 22, ii. 14,
iii. 1, 13, iv. 11. Β. Weiss explains οῧν by connecting the verse closely
with what precedes, as follows ε ‘ if all boasting is bad (even where the
speaker may be ignorant or an unbeliever) it is worse still, it is actual
sin, for one who knows what is right, to abstain from doing it.' This
seems to me very far-fetched. Spitta on the contrary, finding no con-
nexion in the verse as it stands, thinks it must be a familiar quotation
and that οὖν has reference to its original context. Instead of εἰδότι
καλὸν ποιεῖν...ἁμαρτιά ἐστίν, we should rather have expected τὸ εἰδέναι...
ἁμαρτία ἐστίν, or ὃ εἰδὼς ἁμαρτίαν ἔχει, as in John ix. 41 εἰ τυφλοὶ ἣτε
οὐκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν, ib. XV. 22, 24, 1 John i. 8. For the dative
cf. Rom. XiV. 14 οὐδὲν κοινὸν δι’ ἑαυτοῦ εἰ μὴ τῷ λογιζομένῳ τι κοινὸν εἶναι,
ἐκείνῳ κοινόν, 1 Cor. iV. 3 ἐμοὶ δὲ εἷς ἐλάχιστόν ἐστιν ἵνα ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀνακριθῶ
where see Alf„ Clem. R om. 44 ἁμαρτία οὐ μικρὰ ἡμῖν ἔσται ἐὰν...
ἀποβάλωμεν, Hermas Vis. iii. 3 τί μοι ὄφελος ταῦτα ἑωρακότι καὶ μὴ
γινώσκοντι (where, as here, the infinitive would have been the more
usual construction). The phrase ἔσται σοι (01· ἕν σοι) ἁμαρτία 15 common
in LXX., eg. Deut. xv. 9, xxiii. 21, 22, xxiv. 15 3 also ἁμαρτίαν
λαμβάνειν Lev. xix. 17, xxii. 9, xxiv. 15, so Rom. xiv. 20 πᾶν δὲ ὃ οὐκ
ἐκ πίστεως ἁμαρτία ἐστι’.
