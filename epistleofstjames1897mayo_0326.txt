46 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

which seems to show, as Spitta says, that 1311010 15 an allusion here to·
1110 rich man of ver. 10, of. Sirae. xxxiv. (xxx.) 8 foll. μακάριος πλού· ’
σίΟς Ος alfnon„ αμωμος Kal. Ος Οπισω Χρυσίου Οὐκ ἐπορεύθη Τίς G’GTLJ Καὶ
μαΚαΡῑΟΌμΕν OEUTOV- Τίς ἐδΟΚίμασθη GV αὐτῷ Καί, ἐΤΕλΕιωθη“ Καί ΕσΤω Εἰς
καύχησιν. τίς ἐδύνατο παραβῆναι καὶ οὗ παρέβη, Job V. 17 μακάριος
ἄνθρωπος ὃν ἤλεγξεν ὁ Κύριος.

ὃς ὑπομένει παραυ-μύω] So we have μακ. ὃς φάγεται Luke XiV. 15, but
more commonly the subject is expressed by the participle, as Apoe. i. 3
μακάριος ὃ ἀναγινώσκων. Τ1115 verse 11111115 the general exhortation of
ver. 2 to rejoice in trial. It 15 only he who endures that is blessed.
There may be another result of trial, as is shown in the following
verses. Cf. Herm. Vis. ii. 2, 7 μακάριοι ὑμεῖς ὅσοι ὑπομένετε τὴν θλίψιν κ.τ.λ.

δόκιμος] See above on δοκίμιον, ver. 3.

τὸν σ-τέῲανον.] Τ110 word is used (1) for the wreath of victory in the-
games (l Cor. ix. 25, 2 Tim. ii. 5) 3 (2) as a festal ornament (Prov. i.
9, iv. 9, Cant. iii. 11, ΗοΓ111. Sim. viii. 2, Isa. xxviii. 1, Wisd. ii. 8
στεψώμεθα ῥόδων κάλυξι πρὶν ἢ μαρανθῆναι, Judith XV. 13 ἐστεφανώσαντο
τὴν ἐλαίαν); (3) as a public honour granted for distinguished service
01 private worth, as a golden crown was granted to Demosthenes (500
1115 speech on the subject) and Zeno (Diog. L. vii. lO στεφανῶσαι χρυσῷ
στεφάνω ἀρετῆς ει εκα καὶ σωφροσύνης); ieferences to these are veiy
common in inscriptions (4) as a symbol of ioyal 01 priestly dignity.
The last is denied by Trench (NT. Syn. p. 90, στεφανοςί 15 never,
any more than corona 111 Latin, the emblem of royalty,'1 but see 2
Sam. xii. 30 ‘ David took their king's erown (στέφανον) from off his
head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious
stones,' Psa. xxi. 1 foll. ssthe king shall joy in thy strength...thou
settest a crown (στέφανον) of pure gold on his head, ' Zech. vi
ll λήψῃ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ποιησεις στεφάνους και ἐπιθησεις ἐπὶ
την κεφαλὴν Ἰησοῦ τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου, Apoe. iV. 4 ἐπι τους θρόνους
εἶδον εἴκοσι τέσσαρας πρεσβυτέρους καθημέν ους. .κο.ι ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν
στεφάνους χρυσοῦςῑ 111 ch. V. 10 the same eldeis piais 0 the Lamb for
making kings and priests to God out of every nation: ib xiv. 14 one
like the 8011ῢοὶ Man sat on the 01011ἀὲχων ἐπι τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ στεφα-
νον χρυσοῦν. lastly, in the mocking of our L01 d (Matt xxvii. 29) there
surely can be no doubt that the στέφανος and κάλαμος stand for the
crown and sceptre.· virgil speaks of requi coo-onam Aen. 8, 505.
Trenoh however is right in saying that διάδημα 15 more commonly used
in this sense, eg. Isa. lxii. 3 ἔσῃ στέφανος κάλλους ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου καὶ διά-
δημα βασιλείας ἐν χειρὶ Θεοῦ σου. The question then is, from which of
these uses 15 13110 metaphor here derived. Comparing ii. 5, where what
is here said of the erown is repeated of the kingdom, it would seem
natural to take the word as implying sovereignty, and this would agree
With Wisd. V. 16 δίκαιοι λήψονται τὸ βασίλειον τῆς εὐπρεπείας καὶ τὸ διάδημα
τοῦ κάλλους ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου, ih. iii. 8, Dan. vii. 27 ‘the kingdom was
given 130 the saints of the Most High‚’ Apoc. i. 6, 1 Pet. ii. 9 ὑμεῖς
βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα, Rom. V. 17 οἱ τὴν περισσείαν τῆς χάριτος λαμβάνοντες

[1 Trench allows this use- in his Epistles to tho Seven Glzurclzes, p. 111. H. Η. Μ.]
