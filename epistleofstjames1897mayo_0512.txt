others, but by receiving in meekness the ingrafted word, and continu-
ing in the perfect law of liberty. What in fact could be more
contemptible in itself and more fatal to any good influence‚ than for a
man to urge upon others a course which he has determined not to
follow himself, and expect to be rewarded for their saith and works,
when he has no faith or works of his own? The passages from the
NT. quoted in the notes do not contemplate the possibility of a
preacher of righteousness, who has still to be saved from his sins. It
is only in the Apocrypha that we find such unchristian sentiments
as ‘Almsgiving saves from death and purges away all sins’ (Tobit xii. 9).
The other quotations are simply encouragements to sincere but
sluggish workers‚ to throw more energy into their work. It is
allowable to say ⁴ you have done much evil in the past, try and make
up for it by the good you do in the future‚' or ‘ remember that you are
appointed by God to be a teacher or an elder: it is not enough for you
to keep yourself unspotted in the world: you must bring your influence
to bear on others, or you will be found wanting at last ² : but it is not
in accordance with Christian truth to say ‘If you make a convert,
you wil] save your own soul) It appears therefore that we must
fall back on the other interpretation understanding ‘his ' of the
sinner. The chief difficulty in this interpretation is that the apodosis
seems to add so little to the protasis ‘Conversion' to us already
implies ‘ saving the soul' 3 but this need not have been so to the first
readers of the Epistle. To them the words may have meant ⁶ However
many sins the wanderer has been guilty of, still, if he turns, he will be
saved from the death he has deserved‚ and all his sins will be forgiven.’
We can imagine that such a promise might have been a great en-
couragement to those who were dispirited at the state of the back-
sliders in the church to which they belonged, and doubted whether
it was possible to renew them again unto repentance.
