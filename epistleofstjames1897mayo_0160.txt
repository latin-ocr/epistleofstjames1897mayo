The order of thought here is the following: the elder are not
to lord it over the younger3 the younger are to be subject to the
elder, or rather all are to serve one another, girding themselves
with humility. [So far humility is 311 attitude of man towards
man: in what follows it is the attitude of man towards God.]
God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble: if we humble
ourselves before him, 110 will exalt us in due time. lt would seem
from the following clause that this exaltation 101013, 111 the first
place, to the deliverance from tempora] anxieties. The devil
appears in ver. 8 as the cause of these anxieties: he seeks to terrify
the Christians into apostasyg but God will stablish and strengthen
them after 3 short period of suffering. It can hardly be said that
the logical connexion is very strict in these verses. The admo-
nition to the elders has little to do with withstanding the devii,
as the cause of their present anxieties3 and humility towards
111311 does not seem quite the same thing as humility towards
God.

Now take the parallel passage in James : (iv. 1-3) quarrels come
from unsatisfied lusts3 you are unsatisfied‚ because you either do
not ask of G0d‚ or you ask in 3 worldly spirit3 (ver. 4) the friend-
ship of the world is eumity with God ; whoever seeks the world's
friendship‚ thereby becomes the enemy of G0d3 (vv. 5-10> the
Spirit of God within us jealously demands the possession of our
whole heart‚ but gives all the more grace (111 consequence of that
jealousy). Hence the Scripture says, ‘ God resists the proud (1.0.
the worldhv), but gives grace to the humble.' Be subject therefore
to God, and withstand the devil (the prince of this world), and he
will fiee from you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to
you. Repent, and humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he
will exalt you,

Ι think no careful reader 0311 fail to see that Brtiekner has
exactly reversed the truth‚ aud that the order of thought is much
more logical here than 111 St. Peter. All falls naturally under the
