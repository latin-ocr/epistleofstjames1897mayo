STERNNEss or ST. JAMES.

What are we to say to the stern denunciation of this passage? Is
it not inconsistent with the warning against judging and evil-speaking,
given in iv. 112 At any rate it is not inconsistent with the denun-
ciation of the Pharisees by John the Baptist and by our Lord. What
would be presumption in an ordinary Christian may be part of the
commission of a prophet. It was not presumption in Jonah to declaro
the approaching downfall of Nineveh ι the presumption came in where
he expostulated with God for refusing to make good his threats, when
they had produced the desired effect. The prophetie announcement of
impending evil is not inconsistent with the tenderest sympathy, as is
shown by our Lord's lamentation over Jerusalem. Here we can see
ample reason for the strongest warning. The rich represented the
pride of the world. Their success, their triumphant career of selfish
oppressi0n‚ while it left little hope of the possibility of their own
repentance, caused despair in the hearts of the brethren whom they
oppressed. It was the truest kindness on the part of the prophet to Set
before both the fact of imminent judgment revealed to him by the Spirit.
To the rich it was the final invitation, the hand-writing on the wall,
which, if instantly accepted, might still enable them to seek a share in
the humiliation of a Christian (i. 10), to the poor it was the encour-
agement needed to prevent their falling away. Nor is this prophetic
office yet extinct in the Church of Christ. Wherever sin is rampant,
wherever oppression and cruelty prevail, where the denunciation of the
evil—doer is a dangerous and unpopular service, there the heart of the
prophet will still burn within him, till at the last he speaks with his
tongue.

V. 12—20. Paraphrase.

Do not make nse of oaths os any kind, lest yon fall into eon·
demnatz'on. Let all your feelz'ny& whether of joy or sorrow, be
eontrolled ancl sanetzjied by layiny thern before God. In ease os
siekness send to the eldere, and let them pray and anoint the siole
person, ancl the 120cm will censwer the prayer of saith, and, e'f his
siekness is the consequence of past sin, it shall be foryiven. Confess
your offences therefore to one another, and pray for one another, that
yon may be healed. The story of Elq'jah on Mt. Carmel shows how
yreat is the power of a qood man's prayer promptcd by the Spiret of
Goci'. If a brother fcells into sin, yon hnow that he who brinys laem
