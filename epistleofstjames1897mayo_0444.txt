164 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

particular building. If J ames presided over the council at Jerusalem
and wrote the letter preserved in the Acts, he cannot have been
ignorant of πρεσβύτεροι. We need not of course suppose the word to
be used in its later hierarchical sense (see Dict. of Clir. Aut. under
‘Priest'): Bede in loc. understands it simply of age and experience‚
tristato praecipiens ut ipse pro se oret et psallat, iufirmanti autem vel
corpore vel fide mcmdans ut, qui majorem sustinuit playam, plurimorum
se adjutorio et lioe seniorum curare meminerit ,· neque acl juniores
minusque doctos causam suae imbecillitatis referat, rte forte quid per eos
allocutionis aut consilii nocentis accipiat. lt seems better however to
regard it as an official title, denoting the leaders of the local Christian
society (οἱ προϊστάμενοι 1 Thess. V. 12, οἶ ἡγούμενοι Hel). Xiii. 17), who
would exercise a general superintendence over the activity of the
individual members and over the use to be made of the χαρίσματα.
Τ11080 who possessed these gifts in the largest measure would doubtless
be themselves included in the council of elders (τὸ πρεσβυτέριον 1 Tim.
iv. 14). On notification of a case of sickness, the council would, we
may suppose, consider whether it was a fit case f01 the οΧ010180 of the
χάρισμα, and would depute some of their body to attend to the case
and unite in prayer for the sick person (Matt. xviii. 20). Schnecken-

Ep. acl Jac. 12 it is said to be the duty of the deacons, as the eyes of
the bishop, to inform the congregation of all cases of sickness, in order
that they may visit the sick and give such assistance as the president
may think fit. Wetst. quotes from Rabbinical writings showing that
it was the custom to send for a rabbi in sickness, and that sometimes
as many as four visited the sick at one time. Polycarp (ad Phil. 6)
mentions visitation of the siok as a duty of the elders ἐπισκεπτόμενοι
πάντας ἀσθενεῖς, see Acts ΧΧ. 35. 00 the treatment of the sick and the
use of the physician cf. Sir. xxxviii. 1-15 esp. v. 9 ἐν ἀρρωστήματί σου

.προσ·ευξάσθωσανέπ’ aim-611] ‘Let them pr ay (stretching their hands) over
him.' Origen (Hom. in Lev. ii. 4) comparing the ways of propitiation
under the old and new covenants, quotes this verse as follows si quis
autem infirmatur, vocet presbyteros ecclesiae, et imponant ei manus,
unqentes eam in nomine Domini. Et oratio fidei salvabit infirmum et,
si in peccatis fuerit, remittentur ei. 1 (10 not think this implies any
denial of the beneficia] effect of 011 in bodily sickness (as Dr. Plummer
seems to hold in his note 00 1,]118 passage): it is merely that Origen
does not care to dwel] upon it, as it is unconnected with his particular
subject. For the acc. cf. μὴ κλαίετε ἐπ’ ἐμέ Luke xxiii. 28, ὀνομάζειν
ἐπὶ τοὺς ἔχοντας τὰ πνεύματα τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Κῑρίου Acts XiX. 13. It often
alternates with the dat. as in Ζο011.Χ11. 10 κόψονται ἐπ’ αὐτόν, ὡς επ’
ἀγαπητῷ, and σπλαγχνίζομαι επ’ αὐτόν lssabt. XV. 32, Bsalk viii. 2, 1Χ. 22,
