120 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

νάματα ἀπὸ γῆς εἷς τούμφανὲς ἐπιρρέοντα ἀναχεῖται, 27). 447. Βρύει is not
found elsewhere in Nfr. or LXX: in Classical Greek it is used in-
transitively with the dative, as in Arist.. Nur). 45 (βίος) βρύων μελίτταις.
Hom. Il. xvii. 56 ἔρνος βρύει ἄνθεϊ λευκῷ also with gen. (Soph. OC. 17
χῶρος.. βρύων δάφνης, ἐλαίας), properly in refeience to plants bursting
into bud and fiowei, or of the lz'ind in spring (Xen. Cyneq v. 12), then
metaphoiically ἄχη βρύει Α63 ch. Olcoepla. 62, θράσει βρύων Ay. 177,
λόγοι μεστοὶ πνεύματος θείου καὶ βρύοντες δυνάμει Justin M. Tryplc. 9.
The only instance cited from a classical author for the transitive use is
Anacr. (44, 1. 2 Bergk) χάριτες βρύουσι ῥόδα, where however Hermann
reads ῥόδου βρύουσινῑ Justin M. (Pryplc. 114) has τῆς πέτρας ζῶν ὕδωρ
βρυούσης, cf. Chrysostom (loom. in mart„ Migne Patrol. vol. 50, p. 664)
οἱ τάφοι τῶν μαρτύρων βρύουσιν εὐλογίαν, Clem. Hom. ii. 45 πηγὰς ’γῇ
βρύσας Θεὸς. Eustath. in Il. ρ, p. 1126, 42 (ap. Webst.) says it is
properly used of olive blossoms and, later, of springs, as in Acta
Johannis p. 276 Τ. βρύουσαν τὴν πηγὴν εὗρον, Aeta Thomae p. 22, Clem.
Hom. iii. 36. Ὀπή ‘a cleft 111 a rocks elsewhere in NT. only in Heb.
xi. 38, also in LXX, Exod xxxiii. 22, Obad. 3. Πικρόν only used here
and below in N.T. Its use here in preference to ἁλυκόν or ἁλμυρόν 13
doubtless owing to its often being found in a figurative sense, eg.
ver. 14, Ps. lxiv. 3, Sirac. iV. 6 καταρᾶσθαι ἐν πικρίᾳ ψυχῆς. Ib 13
descriptive of sea-water, like amarus, our ⁵ brackish.' The Dead Sea
however, to which St. James is probably alluding, was really bitter
and had both salt and fresh springs on its shores. Other examples of
bitter waters are Marah <Exod. xv. 23), ‘ the water that causeth the
curse ⁷ (Numb. v, 18-27), Apoc. viii. 11. Pliny XII. ii. 103 has a fable
of a fountain of the Sun which was sweet and cold at noon and bitter
and hot at midnight. Antigonus (ilsirab. 148 ap. Wetst.) gives an
account Of such a spring τὸν δὲ Ἱμέραν ἐκ μιᾶς πηγῆς σχιζόμενον τὸ μὲν
ἁλυκὸν τῶν ῥείθρων ἔχειν, τὸ δὲ πότιμονῑ in 4 Esdras V. 9 one of ‘the
prodigies which announce Messiah’s coming is in dulcibus (cquis salsae
invenientmn
