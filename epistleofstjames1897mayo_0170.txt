Testament 15 as nothing in compaiison with the combined impro-
bability of one half of the books having been forged 111 ’6116 second
century. For conside1 the demand thus made upon us. We have
on the one side a century Which beyond all question witnessed the
greatest advance in morality and religion which has ever taken
place on our earth. If this advance 15 to be explained by natui al
causes we must assume the existence of extraordinary powers,
spiritual, moral and intellectual, in the men by whom it was brought
about. The histories of the time, written by contemporaries, as we ·
believe—at any rate written, as even our opponents admit, within a
hundred years, more or less, of the events which they record—tell
us that there were such men then living, and depict them so clearly
and vividly that we seem to be personally acquainted with them.
Again we have letters purporting to be written by some of these
men, which so fully answer the expectations excited by the histories
and soar so high above the ordinary level of human thought, that
they have for some eighteen centuries been regarded by the most
enlightened of mankind as containing, along with the histories, a
divine ideal and an inspired rule of conduct for the whole human
race. On the other hand we have in the second century an age in
which the Christian Church, as far as we can judge from its history
and from the undisputed writings of the time, was decidedly
wanting in power and ability, not merely in comparison with the
first, but in comparison with most of the later centuries. Yet it is
in this feeble age that Baur and his followers have sought to find
the authors of the books which bear, and 10 the judgment of united
Christendom worthily bear, the great names of J ames, Peter, Paul,
and John. It is not one author of this inspired stamp they are
in search of, but four at least3 for there is no pretence that any
one individual could have produced works so diverse in doctrine,
thought and style3 nay, 'their separatist hypotheses make it
necessary for them to assume a fifth, a sixth‚ and even a seventh
author. And yet not a trace of one of them is ’60 be found in
the history or literature of the second century. No one is bold
enough to name a man whom he considers capable of having
written even the least of these works. Would it be at all a wilder
hypothesis if one were to assume that half the plays of Shakspeare
were written by an anonymous author or authors of the time of
