CHAPTER IX

ΟΝ THE STYLE or ST. JAMES

The last chapter contained a survey of the grammatical usages
of our Epistle. In the present chapter I propose to consider what
conclusions may be drawn from that survey, as well as from an
examination of the vocabulary of the Epistle‚ from the use of
rhetorical figures, the rhythm and arrangement of words, in refer—
ence to the Author's command over the resources of the Greek
language and the distinctive qualities of his style.

To deal first with any peculiarities of Infleoeion, he adheres to
classical usage, with the majority of the writers of the N.T., as
regards the gender of πλοῦτος and ζῆλος, which are sometimes
made neuter by St. Paul.

As regards the Future, the reading κερδήσομεν 15 not quite
certain in iv. 13. It is not found elsewhere in the Bible, but the
only trace of the Attic κερδανῶ 15 the doubtful reading in 1 Cor.
ix. 21, while the aor. ἐκέρδησα 15 common. Again, φάνγομαι 111
v. :3 is the only future of ἐσθίω employed in the N.T. In the
LXX. ἔδομαι and φάγομαι are both common, and are sometimes
used 111 the same passage without any difference of meaning,
e g. Numb. xviii. 10 φάὙομαι, Ver. 11 ἔδομαι, Deut. xii. 20 and 24
Ἰφάηιομαι, ver. 22 ἔδεται, so too καταφάΎομαι and κατέδομαι.

Α5 to the Perfect, we find parallels to εἰσελήλυθαν 111 John,
Luke, Paul, and Laconian inscriptions. As there is no instance of
the 3rd pl. either of the imperfect or 2nd aor. in our Epistle,
there is no evidence to show whether James would have used such
barbarous forms as εἴχοσαν with John, or παρελάβοσαν with Paul,
see Hort Appendz'a‘„ p. 165.

As to the Imperative‚ ἤτω 0001115 twice in the LXX. and only
111 0110 other place of the NT. (1 Cor. xvi. 22). It is also found in
inscriptions from Asia Minor. κάθου 0001115 elsewhere in the N,T.
