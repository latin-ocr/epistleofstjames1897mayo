Θεοῦ καὶ ΚυρίουἸησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοῦλος] This epistle and ‘uhab of St.
J ude are the only ones in which we find the writer announcing him-
3011 03 simply δοῦλος. St. Paul joins ἀπόστολος with δοῦλος 111 Rom.
i. 1, Tit. i. 13 more commonly he styles himself simply ἀπόστολος Ἰ. X.,
as in 1 Cor. i. 1, 2 Cor. i. l, Gal. i. 1 (here διὰ Ἰ. Χ.), Ε1111. 1. 1, Ool.i. 1,
and in both epistles to Timothy 3 in Philemon i. l he is δέσμιος Χ. Ἰ. 3
in his earliest epistles (1 Th. 1. 1, 2 Τ11. 1. 1), where he joins Silvanus
and Timothy with himself, he makes use of no distinctive title3 in
Phil. i. 1 110 speaks of himself and Timothy as δοῦλοι Χ. Ἰ. St. Peter
styles himself ἀπόστολος Ἰ. Χ. 111 1113 1313, δοῦλος καὶ ἀπ. Ἰ. Χ. in his 2nd
epistle. St. John's lst epistle is anonymous3 in the 2nd and 3rd he
calls himself ὁ πρεσβύτερος. So far as it goes, this peculiarity of the
epistles of the two brothers, James and J ude, 13 (1) 111 favour of the
view that neither of them was included in the number of the Twelve 3
(2) 113 shows that the writer of this epistle was so well known that it
was unnecessary alike for him and 101 1113 brother to add any special
title to clistinguish him from others who bore the same name3 (3) if
we hold, as there 3001113 every reason for doing, that the writer is the
James whom St. Paul speaks of as the brother of the Lord, we find
here an example of the refusal ‘ to know Christ after the flesh ' which
appears in ii. 1 3 13110 same willingness to put himself on a level with
others which appears in iii. l, 2. The phrase δοῦλος Θεοῦ 13 used of
Moses (Dan. ix. 11, Mal. iv, 4), who is also called θεράπων (ΕΧ. xiv. 31,
Numb. xii. 7, Jos. i. 2) and παῖς (Jos. xi. 12, Χ11. 6). Δοῦλος 13 0130 used
generally of the prophets (Jer. vii. 25, Dan. ix. 10, Α1100. X. 7, (10,).

Τ110 combination Θ. κ. Κ. Ἰ. Χ. 13 found in almost every epistle.
That Θεοῦ 13 used here for the Father is evident from 2 Ρο13. 1. 2 ἐν
ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν. For the absence Of the
