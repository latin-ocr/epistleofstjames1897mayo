guilty, for instance, of an anachronism in assigning to Christ the
words, ‘Think not that Ι 6111 001116 10 destroy the law and the
prophets‚' ‘One jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law'
(Pfleiderer‚ page 492 foll), since they involve the principles of
Paulinism and anti-Paulinism. But why cannot we act here as
we do in the parallel case of the disciples of Socrates? We do not
dispute the genuineness of a Cynic or Cyrenaic or Academic
phrase attributed to Socrates, because he did not carry out these
different lines of thought to the full extent to which each was
carried by his disciples. Yet it is assumed (ι priori that James,
Peter, and John being typica] of particular aspects of Christianity,
anything in their writings which appears to be inconsistent with
that special aspect must be pronounced spuri0us3 that even a man
30 many-sided and so full of growth as St. Paul must be tied down
to the ideas which occupied him during a certain critical period of
the Church's development. If we were to impose the same rule
on Mr. Gladstone‚ how little we should leave him of all the books
and speeches which now bear witness to his incessant activity and
versatility of mind.

But perhaps the most mischievous manifestation of the (ι priori
method is when it seizes on some small side-incident, and makes
it the corner-stone of a huge theory, by which all the phenomena
are to be explained, or, in the event of a too stubborn resistance,
to be exploded. Such an incident is the difference between St.
Peter and St. Paul, of which passing mention is made in Galatians
ii. 1132, and in which Baur finds the key to the whole of the
early history of the Church as well as to the Christian literature ’
of the first two centuries. It might really seem as if to some of
his followers the main article of the Creed was ‘I believe in the
quarrel between Peter and Paul, and in the well—meaning but un—
successful attempts of Luke and others to smooth it over and keep
it in the background?

It may encourage those who are fearful as to the results of the

n n present attack on the integrity of the books of the New Testament,

to call to mind the history of 1116 361116 struggle in regard to the
writings of Classical authors. There too a narrow α priori dogma—
tism has in times past attempted to deprive us of half the dia—
logues of Plato and some of the noblest satires of Juvenal 3 but in
the great majority of instances the result of the close examination
