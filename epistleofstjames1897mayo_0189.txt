'SPITTA ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE clxix

polation in chap. ii. 1; still my opinion as to the genuineness of
the Epistle, as a whole, remains unshaken. The main point of
attack is of course the universally acknowledged reticence as to
higher Christian doctrines and to the life and work of our Lord.
What is new is (1) the careful examination of the two passages in
which the name of Christ occurs, and (2) the attempt to show that
there is nothing in the Epistle which may not be paralleled from
Jewish writings. As regards (1) it is pointed out that in both
passages the sentence would read as well or better if the name of
Christ were omitted. To take first the case which offers most
difficulties from the conservative point of view (ii. 1), μὴ ἐν προ-
σωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν τοῦ κυρίου [ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ]
τῆς δόξης, it is pointed out that the construction of τῆς δόξης has
been felt as a great difficulty by all the interpreters, and that this
difficulty disappears if we omit the words in brackets. We then
have the perfectly simple phrase ‘the saith of the Lord of glory,'
the latter words, or words equivalent to them, being frequently
used of God in Jewish writings, as in Ps. xxix. 3 ὁ θεὸς τῆς δόξης,
Ρ5, xxiv. 7-10 ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς δόξης, and especially in the Book of
Enoch, 04). xxii. 14⁴ ηὐλόὙησα τὸν κύριον τῆς· δόξης, xxv. 3 ὁ μέγας
κύριος τῆς δόξης, ib. ver. 7, xxvii. 5 ηὐλόὙησα τὸν κύριον τῆς
δόξης καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ ἐδήλωσα καὶ ὕμνησα, ib. ver. 3.¹ It is
next pointed out that there are undoubted examples of the inter-
polation of the name of Christ in the N. T„ eff. Col. i. 2, 2 Thess. i. 1,
James v. 14, and that the use of the phrase κύριος τῆς δόξης ot'
Christ in 1 Cor. ii. 8 may have led to the insertion of the gloss here.
In the preceding verse (i. 27), which is closely connected with this.
ὁ θεὸς καὶ πατήρ is represented as watching over the orphan and
widow3 the only true service in His sight is to visit them in their
affiiction, and keep oneself unspotted from the world. The second
chapter is still occupied with our treatment of the poor. We are
warned not to let our saith in the Lord be mixed up with respect
of persons (v. 1) and worldly motives (v. 4), and (in v. 5) we are
reminded that it is the poor whom God has chosen to be rich in
saith. Must not the ‘Lord' of the intermediate verse be the same
as the ‘God' of i. 27 and ii. 5? The same conclusion is sug-
gested by a comparison with the lst Epistle of Peter, which may
be regarded as in some respects a Christianized version of our
Epistle. There are many resemblances between 1 Pet. i. 17—21
