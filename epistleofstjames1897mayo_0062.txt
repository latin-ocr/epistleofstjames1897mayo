Hellenism
in Syria.

xlii ΙΝ TRODUCTION

Nazareth would, we may feel certain, have been eagerly taken ad—
vantage of by all its inmates. While accepting, therefore, the view
which seems to be best supported, that Jesus and his brothers
usually spoke Aramaic, we are surely not bound to suppose that
with towns like Sepphoris and Tiberias in their immediate vicinity,
with Ptolemais, Scythopolis,1 and Gadara at no great distance, they
remained ignorant of Greek. In the eyes of the Scribes they might
‘ never have learnt letters‚’ since they had not attended the rabbi-
nical schools at J erusalem, but the ordinary education of Jewish
children and the Sabbath readings in the synagogue would give
sufficient start to enable any intelligent boy to carry on his studies
for himself 3 while the example of Solomon and the teaching of
the so-called ‘ sapiential ' books, with which the writer of our
Epistle was familiarly acquainted, held up the pursuit of knowledge
and wisdom as the highest duty of man? Not many years before,
four of the most accomplished literary men of the time were
natives of Gadara, Philodemus the Epicurean, a friend of Cicero
and one of the poets of the Anthology‚ whose writings fill the larger
part of the Herculanean scrolls3 Theodorus the instructor of
Tiberius in rhetoric3 Meleager, the famous writer of epigrams and
collector of the first Greek Anthology3 and Menippus the Cynic,
whose dialogues were imitated by Varro and Lucian.3 The question
whether our Epistle was originally written in Greek will be eon-
sidered further on 3 but these considerations may perhaps lead us to
the conclusion that it was not more impossible for a peasant of
Galilee to learn to write good Greek, than for one who had been
brought up as a Welsh peasant to learn to write good English, or
for a Breton to write good French 3 far more likely, we might think,
than that a elever Hindoo should, as so many have done, make
himself familiar with the best English authors, and write a good
English style. Connected with this is the question, as to which
something will be said in a future chapter, whether there are any

1 Neubauer (Strod. Bz'bl. 1. p. 67) says, ‘ The inhabitants of Beth Sheau or Scytho-
polis are mentioned as pronouneing Hebrew badly, and Scythopolis is considered an
exclusively Greek town.’ See T. K. Abbott, Efflays, 1891, pp. 129—182.

2 See Schirrer, chz'sh Peoplc, ἓξ ‘27 (on Sehool and Synagogue) with the references
to Philo and Josephus. The visit to Egypt (Matt. i. 13 foll.) suggests another
eliannel for Hellenistic influences.

3 Strabo says of Gadara (xvi. 29), ἐκ δὲ τῶν Γάδοίρων Φιλόδημός τε ὃ Ἐπικούρειος καὶ
Μελέαγρος καὶ Μένιππος ὁ σπουδογέλοιος καὶ Θεόδωρος ὁ καθ’ ἡμᾶς ῥήτωρ. Meleager in
his epitaph on himself (Αιιίῖι. Pal. vii. 417) calls it the Syrian Athens, πάτρα δέ με
τίκτει Ἀτθὶς ἐν Ἀσσυρίοις ναιομένη Γαδάροις.
