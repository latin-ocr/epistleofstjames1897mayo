142 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

οῧαὶ ἡμῖν ὅτι ταλαιπωροῦμεν, V. 20 τεταλαιπώρηκε πᾶσα ἡ γῇ (‘1'S spoiled ’)‚
Micah ii. 4 ταλαιπωρίᾳ ἐταλαιπωρήσαμεν (⁴ we be utterly spoiled') 3 so
ταλαιπωρία below v. 1. In Isa. xxxiii. 1 it has a transitive force ‘to
affiict another] This is perhaps the only place in which the imperative
is used, and I think it is best understood of voluntary abstinence from
comforts and luxuries (the δαπανᾷν of iv, 3, τρυφᾷν οξ V. 5) 3 so Erasmus,
Grotius (cfflsz'yite ipsos vosmet jejuniis et aliis cooperis σκληραγωγίαις),
Corn. a Lap. and the Romanists generally, cf. Ps. xxxviii. 6 ἐταλαιπώ-
ρησα καὶ κατεκάμφθην. On the other hand Alf, following Huther
as usual, translates ‘ be wretched in your minds from a sense of your
sinfulness', but if we consider that St. James himself was noted for
his asceticism, that St.. Paul bids Timothy κακοπάθησον ὡς καλὸς στρα-
τιώτης Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ (2 Tim. ii. 3, 4, 5) and himself kept his body in
subjectior] (1 Cor. ix. 27) 3 that fasting, sackcloth and ashes were
ordinary accompaniments of repentance (Luke x. 13, Dan. ix. 3,
Joel i. 13, 14, Jer. iv. 8, [sa. xxii. 12, cf. Ps. XXXV. 13, 14); lastly that
our Lord's charge to those who would follow him was to deny them-
selves and take up their cross‚ we shall see no difficulty in adher-ing to
the usual meaning of the word.

πενθήσατε καὶ κλαύσατε] ‘Mourn and weep,' coupled in Luke vi. 25
οὐαὶ ὑμῖν οἶ γελῶντες νῦν, ὅτι πενθήσετε καὶ κλαύσετε, Mai-k xvi. 10. This
is a call to the godly sorrow spoken of in-2 Cor. vii. 10 and Matt. v. 4.

ὁ γέλως ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος μετατραπήτω.] The verb does not occur else-
where in the NJJJ. For the thought cf. Eccles. ii. 2, vii. 2—6. Tobit
ii. 6, Sirac. xxi. 20, xxvii. 13, Luke vi. 21, 25 3 and for the expression
4 Maec. vi. 5 (of resistance to torture) ὃ δὲ μεγαλόφρων κατ’ οὐδένα τρόπον
μετετρέπετο, also the use of the simple verb in Pind. lstlzm. iii. 16 ·
τρέψαι ἦτορ πρὸς εὐφροσύναν, Ap. Rh. iv. 620 ἐπὶ γηθοσύνας τρέπετο νόος.
Several MSS. have the more usual μεταστραφήτω with which we may
compare Joel ii. 28 ὃ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἷς σκότος, 1 Maec. iX.
41 μετεστράφη ὁ γάμος εἷς πένθος καὶ ἡ φωνὴ μουσικῶν εἷς θρῆνον. ,

κατήφειαν.] Classical, only found here in the Bible. R describes the
condition of one with eyes cast down like the public-an in Luke xviii.
13, cf. Philo M. 2. p. 331 λυπουμένων ὀφθαλμοὶ συννοίας γέμουσι καὶ κατη-

φ 10. ταπεινώθητε ἐνώπιον Κυρίου] Cf. 1. 9, 1 Pet. V. 6 ταπεινώθητε {wo
τὴν κραταιὰν χεῖρα τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἵνα ὑμᾶς ὑψώσῃ ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς, Matt. xxiii.
12, Luke xiv. 11, 1 Sam. ii. 7, 8, Job xxii. 28, 29, Prov. xxix. 23, Ezek.
xvii. 24, Isa. lvii. 15, Sirac. ii. 17 οἶ φοβούμενοι Κύριον ἑτοιμάσουσι καρδίας
αὗτῶν καὶ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ταπεινώσουσι τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν. The adv. ἐνώπιον
is Hellenistic, it has much the same sense as παρὰ Θεῷ in i. 27, cf.
Luke i. 6 δίκαιοι ἐν. Θεοῦ, 1 Cor. i. 29, 2 Cor. i. 2, &c The adj. ἐνώπιος
is found in Theocr. xxii. 152. For the use of the passive aorist with
middle sense see 1Viner, p. 327, and compare πλανηθῇ in v. 19.

καὶ ὑψώσει efficis] Sums up the preceding promises.

11. μὴ καταλαλεῖτε ἀλλήλων] Returns to ‘che 'topic Of 1. 26, 11. 12, 111.
1-10, 14 : cf. l Pet. ii. 1 ἀποθέμενοι πάσας καταλαλιάς, ib. ver. 12, iii. 16
2 Cor. xii. 20, Rom. i. 30 κατάλαλος, ib. xiv. 3—10,13, Psa. xlix. 20
κατά τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ (roi) καταλαλεῖς, ib. ci. 5 ib. lxxviii. 19 κ. Θεοῦ, Hermas
