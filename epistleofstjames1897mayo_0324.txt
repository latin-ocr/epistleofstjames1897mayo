44 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

33 311 unbeliever‚ by giving it a sarcastic force, ‘let the rich man, if he
will, glory in his degradation.' So too B. 1170133, who however explains
ταπείνωσις of the speedy ruin which awaits him. It must be allowed that
such bitterness of sarcasm is not impossible in the writer of ii. 19, iv,
4, V. 1-63 but could he so early in his letter, in cold blood so to speak,
have thus anathematized the rich as a class, when we know from iv.
13-16 that some of those to whom he writes were wealthy traders?
How could one who had known Nicodemus and Mary of Bethany, Joseph
of Arimathaea and Barnabas, have thus denied to the rich the privilege
of Christian membership‘l According to the correct interpretation all
that he does is to repeat his master's warning in Matt. vi. 19 foll„ xvi.
26, Mark X. 24, Luke xii. 15-21, xvi. 0-31 3 so St. Paul 1 Cor. vii.
29-31‚ cf. Herm. Sim. ii. 4 foll. and Zahn ›S'ltz'czen p. 53.

ὅτι. ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται.] Α quotation (given more fully
in Pet. i. 24) from Isa. XI. 6 πᾶσα σὰρξ χόρτος καὶ πᾶσα δόξα ἀνθρώπου
ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου· ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν : of. Psa. lxxxix.
6. ciii. 15. It is evident that this is not a special threat intended
only for the rich, but a general truth applicable to all, though more
likely to be kept out of sight by the rich than by others. ‘ Let him
glory in that which the world holds to be humiliation, but which is
indeed the commencement of everlasting glory, because he must soon
pass away from earth and leave behind the riches in which he 13 now
tempted to glory.’ Pliny N. ll. 21. 1 has the same comparison‚ Flores
odoresque in diem 92'9722‘6 (natura) mccyua admonitione hominum, quae
spectatissime floreant celerrime marcescere.

παρελεύσεται.] Used in this sense, as well in common, as in Hellenistic
Greek: Cf. Mark xiii. 31 ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ ’γῆ παρελεύσεται. 113 13 not
necessary to understand a new subject πλοῦτος from πλούσιος, though 11,
13 possible that the equivalent phrase in the LXX. δόξα ἀνθρώπου may
have been in the writer's mind3 but the rich ,man as such, whether
believer or unbeliever, must quickly disappear‚ and, like the flower, lose
τὴν εὐπρέπειαν τοῦ προσώπου.

11. ἀνέτειλεν γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος.] Gnomic aorist, as in the original Isa. xl. 7,
and below ver, 24, cf. NViner, p. 347 note, Krueger‚ Gr. §53 10.

σὺν τῷ καύσωνι.] It is questioned whether κ. here means ‘ heat’
simply, or a special burning wind blowing from the eastern desert over
Palestine and from the south over Egypt. It is used of wind in the
following : Jonah iV. S ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν ἥλιον καὶ προσέταξεν
ὁ Θεὸς πνεύματι καύσωνι, Ezek. xvii. 10 (of a vine) οὐχὶ ἅμα τῷ ἅψασθαι
αὐτῆς ἄνεμον τὸν καύσωνα ξηρανθήσεται, 011 which Jerome says Austro
fiante qui Graece καύσων interpretatur, Ez. xix, 10, Hos. xii. 1, Jer.
xviii. 17, Hos. xiii. 15 ἐπάξει καύσωνα ἄνεμον Κύριος ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου ἐπ’
αὐτόν : and the destructive effect of the wind generally on vegetation 13
referred to in Psa. ciii. 16, Gen xli. 6, Virg. Ed. ii. 5Sfloribu3 Austrum
inmzisi, Prop. iv. 5. 59 vidi eqo odorati victura rosaria Paesti sub matu-
tino cocta jacere noto. There are however passages in which κ. seems
more naturally understood of heat, eg. Luke. xii. 55 (when ye see) νότον
πνέοντα λέγετε ὅτι καύσων ἔσται, Matt. xx. 12 ἴσους τοῖς βαστάσασι τὸ
βάρος τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τὸν καύσωνα, Sirac. 18. 15 οὐχὶ καύσωνα ἀναπαύσει
