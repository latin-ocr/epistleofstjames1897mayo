ccxxvi INTRODUCTION

frequency of these parallels in St. James does not require us to
suppose that he had been trained in the use of their figures of
speech by the Greek rhetoricians, but is probably to be traced
to his familiarity with Hebrew poetry, which is founded on the
principle of parallelism.1

Asgyndcton :

This figure is most commonly used in enumeration (1) and
antithesis (2). Of the former we have examples in iii. 15 οὐκ
ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ σοφία ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη, ἀλλά ε’πίὙειος, ψ υ χ ι κ ή,
δ α ι μ ο ν ι ὡ δ η ς, and 17 ἦ ἄνωθεν σοφία πρῶτον μὲν ἁνγνή ἐστιν,
ἔπειτα εἰρηνική,’ ε’ π ι ε ι κ η’ ς, ε ὐ π ε ι θ ή ς, μ ε σ τ ὴ ἐλέους καὶ
καρπῶν ἀγαθῶν, ἀδιάκριτος, ἀνυπόκριτος, i. 19 βραδὺς
εἰς τὸ λαλῆσαι, ,Β ρ α δ z) ς εἰς ὀρνγὴν, v. 6 κατεδικάσατε, ε’ φ ο ν ε ύ-
σατε τὸν δίκαιον. Of the latter we have an example in the
verse last quoted, ἐφονεύσατε τὸν δίκαιον being followed by οὐκ
ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν, where it would have been more usual to
inserto δέ before οὐκ; also in i. 19 ταχὺς εἰς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι, βρα-
δὺς εἰς τὸ λαλῆσαι, 1. 27 ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ὀρφανοὺς καὶ χήρας,
δι’ σ πιλο ν ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν, ii. 13 ἡ Γγὰρ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ποιή-
σαντι ἔλεος· κ α τ α κ α υ χ ἃ τ α ι ἕλεος κρίσεως, where again we
might have expected τὸ δὲ ἔλεος κατακαυχᾶται. But the writer
also uses asyndeton to express a result, iv. 2 οὐκ ἔχετε· φονεύετε (or
φθονεῖτε if that is the true reading)...oz'2 δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν·
μάχεσθε.

Ι have mentioned that St.. J ames makes no attempt at elaborate
periods. There are Ι think only two sentences in his Epistle which
exceed four lines: one 15 11. 2-4, where the construction 15 clearly
defined, ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃ α’νὴρ χρυσοδακτύλιος...εἰσέλθῃ δὲ καὶ
πτωχός...ἐπιβλε’ψητε δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν φοροῦντα...καὶ εἴπητε...
καὶ τῷ πτωχῷ εἴπητε...οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς; the other
(iv. 13-15) c’tsrye νῦν οἱ λέγοντες Σήμερον πορευσόμεθα...οἵτινες
οὐκ ἐπίστασθε...ἀντὶ τοῦ λέγειν Ἐὰν ὁ Κύριος θέλῃ, ζήσομεν
κ.τ.λ. contains, it is true, an anacoluthon, but the mind is not kept
in suspense; each clause 15 intelligible in itself. On the other
hand, we find sentences of ten lines in the lst epistle of Peter, of

¹ See Jebb's SacrecZ Litcmlurff, Lond. 1820, in which James i. 9, 10, 15, 17, 22, 25,
iii. 1-12, iv. 6-10, v. 1-6, are analysed as specimens of parallelism.
