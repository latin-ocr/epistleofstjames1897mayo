96 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

of no value: one may go further and say that its existence is incapa-
ble of proof. The writer, with his usual modesty, puts himself in the
background, does not claim to bo the representative of perfect working
saith, but supposes another to speak. Usually the phrase ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις
is used of an objection, like νὴ Δία, at enim, as 1 Cor. xv. 35 ἇ.ε’.τ. πῶς
ἐγείρονται οἱ νεκροίς ancl in Classical Greek, Xen. Cyr. iv. 3. 10 ἀλλ’
ἐρεῖ τις ἴσως...ἀλλ’ εἴποι ἄν τις, and so some would take it here: ‘It
may be objected that works and saith are different forms of genuine
religion ε your form may be saith, mine works‚ both equally acceptable
in the sight of G0d.’ The explanation is untenable„ because it makes
the imaginary objector treat the writer as though it was the latter
who was exalting faith above works, instead of the opposite. Some
commentators have had recourse to conjecture, as Pfleiderer (cited by
Spitta) who thinks πίστιν and ἔργα should be transposed, and Spitta
himself, who thinks that a reply of the solifidian (to the effect that
there may be a genuine latent saith) must have been lost after ἐρεῖ τις,
and that such a reply is implied in the words ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ of vers.
20. I prefer to give to ἀλλά a strengthening force = immo, like πλήν
in Matt. XXVi. 64, Cf. John xvi. 2 ἀποσυναγώγους ποιήσουσιν ὑμᾶς· ἀλλ’
ἔρχεται ὥρα ἵνα πᾶς ὁ ἀποκτείνων ὑμᾶς δόξῃ λατρείαν προσφέρειν τῷ Θεῷ,
Luke xvii. 8, ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὖτῷ,· (which I think should be translated
⁶ nay! will he not rather say unto him 2 ⁷) 2 Cor. vii. 11 ’πόσην κατειργά-
σατο ὑμῖν σπουδήν, ἀλλὰ ἀπολογίαν, ἀλλὰ ἀγανάκτησιν, ἀλλὰ φόβον, κ,τ.λ.,
Phil. i. 18 ἐν τούτῳ χαίρω· ἀλλὰ καὶ χωρήσομαι, Hel). iii. 16 τίνες παρε-
πίκραναν,· ἀλλ’ οὐ πάντες; with Alf.'s n.‚ 1 Pet. iii. 14 ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε
...μακάριοι. Instead of the future the optative with ἅν would be more
common in classica] Greek, but the latter form is rather avoided by
the Hellenistic writers, occuring only eight times in NT. (thrice in
Luke‚ five times in Acts), see A. Buttmann, p. 188, who cites Rom. v.
T μόλις γὰρ ὑπὲρ δικαίου τις ἀποθανεῖται, dvc. In Latin the future (licet
(aliquis is far more common than the present subjunctive, see Roby,
vol. ii. pref. p. 101 foll.

κάγὼ.] In the N.T. the contracted is more usual than the uncon-
tracted form, see WH. app. p. 145, XViner p. 51. We also find κάμοί,
κάμέ, κάκεῖ, κάκεῖνος. Α close parallel to the form of this sentence is
found in Theoph, Autol. i. Ξ.) δεῖξόν μοι τὸν ἄνθρωπόν σου, κᾶγώ σοι δείξω
τὸν Θεόν μου.

χωρὶς τῶν ἐ’ργων.] We must supply σου just as we supply μου after
τὴν πίστιν. Cf. Rom. iii. 28 λογιζόμεθα δικαιοῦσθαι πίστει ἄνθρωπον χωρὶς
ἔργων νόμου, sil). iv. 6 ὁ Θεὸς λογίζεται δικαιοσύνην χωρὶς ἔργων.

ἐκ τῶν ἕργων.] So V. 21 below and iii. 13 ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς.

19. σὺ πιστεύεις ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν ὁ Oscis] This reading supported by A.
Sin. Pesh. aa. seems preferable to that of B (accepted by WH.) εἷς Θεός
ἐστιν, as it expresses a more definite belief in the actual formula
of Jewish orthodoxy given in Dent. vi. 4 ἄκουε Ἰσραήλ, Κύριος ὃ Θεὸς
ἡμῶν Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν, Mark xii. 29, 1 Cor. viii. 4, 6, Hermas lisand. i.
πρῶτον πάντων πίστευε ὅτι εἷς ἐστιν ὁ Θεός, Philo Ley. (ld (J. M. 2. p. 562
Ἰουδαίους δεδιδαγμένους ἐξ αὐτῶν σπαργάνων ἕνα νομίζειν τὸν πατέρα καὶ
ποιητὴν τοῦ κόσμου Θεόν. Much is said of the excellence of the μοναρχικὴ
