though each fully allows and even asserts the doctrine complementary
to that which may be called peculiarly his own.

III. 1—12. Pal-aphrase.

Do not be eazqer to assume the responsibilities of teaeleers. Hard as
it is for man to avoid stiimbling] in action, it is harder still to avoid
it iii speech, ‚· so tliat to quide the touque ariylzt may be reqarded as
a test of Christian mataritgs. As tlte movements of tlte liorse or tlte
sliip are controlled by tlte little bit in the mouth or rudder in the sterit,
so tlte whole aetivitgy of mari is directed bys tlte use made os tlte torique.
Like the spark wliicli sets tlte forest ori fire, the torique, by some little
insiffliificaiit word, ean boast of settingy on fire tlte what of mortalita,
the whole round of this moriat life. In the microcosm of orzan’s
nature tlze touque represents the uviriyliteous world, and is used by
Satan as liis oryaii. Man lias learnt to tame the most savaye aad
veriomoas os animals, but tlte touque is mztameable aoid never at rest,

The teacher here referred to is of course, in the first instance, the
teacher in the congregation. It is the same warning as we read in i.
19 3 the same also is given by St. Paul in 1 Cor. xiv. 26—40. From
the latter passage we learn that the Christian assemblies were often
soenes of great confusion, in which a number of persons, women as
well as men, were trying to make themselves heard at the same time,
one with a psalm, one with a revelation, one with a teaching, and so
on. St. Paul insists that those who prophesy, or speak with unknown
tongues, should speak by two or at the most by three (with which we
may compare the μὴ πολλοί of St. J ames) ‚ and that by course, so that all
things may be done decently and in order. It does not seem that there
was any distinct order of teachers : each member of the congregation
was at liberty to speak as he was moved by the Holy Spirit, in accordance
with the prophecy of Joel, quoted by St. Peter on the day of Pente·
eost. But even the exer-eise of the gifts of the Spirit was to be kept
under control 3 the spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets :
there was to be nothing orgiastie in the Christian service. If there
was anything of mere anima] excitement, of pushing‚ or display, or
want of consideration for others, this was a sign that the speaker
was not exclusively infiuenced by the Spirit of God (vv. 14, 15). The
