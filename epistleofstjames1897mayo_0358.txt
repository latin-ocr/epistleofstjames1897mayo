78 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν, 4 According to the command of Christ J esus who is our
hope.' Why should we object to the similar translation here, ‘the
saith of oui Lord J esus Christ, who' ls the glory’ 2 The only question
is whether the abstract δόξα is thus used of a person. Bengel cites
Luke li. 31 τὸ σωτήριον ὃ ἡτοίμασας...δόξαν λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, Eph. 1. 17
ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὁ Πατὴρ τῆς δόξης, 1 Pet. iv. 14
εἰ ὀνειδίζεσθε ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ, μακάριοι, ὅτι τὸ τῆς δόξης καὶ τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ
Πνεῦμα ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀναπαύεται (where he takes δόξης as an appellation of
Christ). Perhaps more striking parallels are 2 Pet. i. 17 φωνῆς ἐνεχθεί-
σης τοιᾶσδε ὑπὸ τῆς μεγαλοπρεποῦς δόξης (4 The words seem a periphrasis
for God Himself‚' Alfi), Col. i. 27 τί τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου
τούτου, ὅ ἐστιν Χριστὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, ἡ ἐλπις τῆς δόξης, Rom. ix. 4, where it
stands For the Shekinah (cf. 1 Sam. iv. 22, Psa. lxxviii. 61, ib. cvi. 20,

Isa. iv. 5), John xvii. 22 ἐγὼ τὴν δόξαν ην δεδωκάς μοι δέδωκα αῧτοῖς, vl).

i. 14 ἐθεασάμεθα τὴν δόξαν ἀυτοῦ, δόξαν ὡς μονογενοῦς παρὰ Πατρὸς (Of
which Westcott says (p. xlvii.)‘ Christ the Light of the world* 1s seen
by the believer to be the manifested Glory of God ')‚ Heb. i. 3 ἀπαύγασμα
δόξης, cf. J nstin Tryph. 61 ὃ Θεὸς γεγέννηκε δύναμίν τινα ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ λογικὴν,
ἥτις καὶ δόξα Κυρίου καλεῖται, ποτὲ δὲ ὗιὸς, ποτὲ δὲ σοφία. similarly
μεγαλωσύνη is used Heb. i. 3, and δύναμις Matt. XXVi. 64, cf. Clem.
Rom. i. 16 τὸ σκῆπτρον τῆς μεγαλωσύνης τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν Χριστὸς
Ἰησοῦς. We may suppose that the ieason why the word δόξα stands
here alone, 1ν1131101113ἡμῶν 01· τοῦ Πατρός, is in order that it may be
understood 1n its fullest and widest sens e of Him who alone comprises
all glory m Himself. This interpretation is confirmed by the rhy thm
which makes a natural pause before τῆς δόξης.

Since the above note was written I find that Mr. Bassett in his
commentary takes τῆς δόξης, as Ι have done, in apposition to
τοῦ Κυρίου. In an appendix on this verse, to show that the name
Shekinah was used by the Jews of God or of the Messiah‚ he
cites Psa. lxxxv. 9 ἐγγὺς τῶν φοβουμένων αὐτὸν τὸ σωτήριον αὑτοῦ, τοῦ
κατασκηνῶσαι δόξαν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἡμῶν, on which Jennings notes 4 the
glory is certainly as in Psa. lxiii. 2, Zech. vi. 12, 13, that of the
Divine Presence which now again clawns on the restored people...St.
J ohn⁷s description of the Advent of Christ offers an approximate
parallel...“the Word was made flesh and dwelt (ἐσκήνωσε) among
us ancl we beheld his glory...full of grace and truth ⁷' : so here ver. 10
tells of a concurrence of Divine goodness and truth.' Bassett refers
also to Hagg. ii. 7, 9, Zech. ii. 5 41, saith the Lord, will be [the] glory
in the niidst of her,' ib. V. S, 10, and to the book Sohar,1 where the
Son of God is spoken of as the Shekinah. Thus δόξα would appear to
be equivalent to Emmanuel, cf. Apoc. xxi. 3 ἡ σκηνὴ (= Shekinah) τοῦ
Θεοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, LeV. xxvi. 11, 12 θήσω τὴν σκηνήν μου ἐν ὑμῖν
καὶ. . ,ἐμπεριπατήσω ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἔσομαι ὑμῶν Θεὸς καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε μοι λαός,
and Pirke Aboth iii. 3 ‘two that sit together and are occupied in
w01 ds of Thoiah haxe the Shekinah among them, ' wheie Taylor com-
