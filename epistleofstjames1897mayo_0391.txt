ἦ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκὸς ὃ γαστὴρ καθίσταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν. The tongue
represents the world, because it 15 that member by which we are
brought into communication with other men; it is the organ of
society, the chief channe] of temptation from man to man. Here it
is described as ἡ σπιλοῦσα τὸ σῶμα, but in 1. 27 this 15 said to be the
effect of the worldg true religion is shown by keeping oncself ἄσπιλον
ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου. Olshausen, Stier‚ and Lange give this meaning to the
passage, and I think it is hinted at by the Greek commentators.
Dr. Taylor has pointed out (J. ofPln'l. xviii. p. 320) that, in place of
the phrase ἡ γλῶσσα, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, Hermas uses ἡ πονηρὰ
ἐπιθυμία ln Mami. Xii. 1 μισήσεις την ποιηραν ἐπιθυμιαν και χαλιναγω-
’γησεις αυτὴν καθὼς βούλει (cf. above Vsssst 4, ὅπου ἡ ὁρμὴ τοῦ εὐθύνοντος
βούλεται), ἀγρια γάρ ἐστιν ἡ ἐπιθυμια η ποι ηρα και δυσκόλως ημεροῧται (ci.
below 1701. 8, οὐδεις δαμάσαι δύναται). Again‚ 115112, he uses the
phrase οὐκ ἀπέχεται τῆς γλωσσης’ εν ῂ πονηρεύεται.

Dr. Taylor further illustrates the text, if understood in the sense
universitas inquitatis, from T. B. Berachoth l5b, ‘ Life and death are
in the hand of the tongue. Has the tongue a hand? No, but as the
hand kills, so the tongue. The hand kills only at close quarters: the
tongue is called an arrow as killing at a distance. An arrow kills at
forty or fifty paces: but of the tongue it is said (Psa. lxiii. 9)
‘⁴ they have set their mouth in heaven and their tongue goeth through
the earth.’' It ranges over the whole earth and reaches to heaven.'

It may be worth while to mention that the Peshitto, followed by
Morus, Bassett and others, takes κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας independently of ἡ
γλώσσα, and supplies ὕλη as subject: ‘the tongue 15 the fire, the world
of wickedness the forest' (which it consumes). It 15 possible that
there was an old gloss ὕλη intended to explain a difficulty; but it,
is inconsistent with the general thought: the tongue sets on fire the
τροχὸς ’γενέσεως not the κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, and it has been alread)⁷
shown that to put the stop after ἀδικίας gives an impossible construction
for the following clause.

The word καθίσταται literally means ‘is set,' ‘is constituted.'1 It
is opposed to ὑπάρχω, because it implies a sort of adaptation or
development as contrasted with the natural or original state,· to
γίνομαι, because it implies something of fixity. So in iv. 4 ὃς ἐὰν
βουληθῇ φίλος εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου, ἐχθρὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ καθίσταται, ‘ Whoever will
be a friend of the world thereby becomes (is constituted) an enemy of
God.' Cf. Thuc. iV. 92 πρὸς τοὺς ἀστυγείτονας πᾶσι τὸ ἀντίπαλον κα,

1. 0. the world as convelted by our diseased imaginations into an opaq'ue look' ing-
glass 1²01 selfishness, instead of a 11111110117 for the 11011 of God.Compa1e Rom. 11.
16 τὸ σῶμα τῆς ἀδικίας. —A. ]

¹ That it 15 passive and not middle may be insened fi om the fact that out of the
twenty-two instances in Bruder, while sixteen belong to the active voice and two are
lst aor. pass„ there are only four examples of the ambiguous form καθίσταται, two
of which are those cited above from this epistle, and the other two (Heb. v. 1 πᾶς
ἀρχιερεὺς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων λαμβανόμενος’ υπὲρ ἀνθρωπων καθίσταται, ‘is ordained sel lnen’
[A. V. ]‚ and viii. 3) are undoubtedly passive. Westcott compares Philo M. 2 ‚.p
