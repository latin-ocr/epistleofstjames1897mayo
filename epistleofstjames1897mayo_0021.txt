CHAPTER Ι
THE ΑΠΤΗΟΡι

ΤΗΕ writer calls himself ‘ Jacob' (from which our name ‘James’
is derived through the Italian ‘Giacomo'), and describes himself as
‘a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ! As the name
was very common in the first century, and the description is
one which is applicable to all Christians‚ it is evident that he
must have been distinguished from other Jacobs by position or
character, so as to justify him in addressing the ‘ Twelve Tribes in
the Dispersion' with the tone of authority which is so marked a
feature in the Epistle before us. This inference receives support
from the Epistle of Jude‚ the writer of which styles himself
‘servant of J esus Christ and brother of Jacob‚' evidently assuming
that his brother’s name would carry weight with those whom he
addresses.

The Epistle of Jacob, or James, is strongly contrasted not
only with the Epistles to the Romans and Galatiam, against which
some have supposed it to be directed, but also with the F irst
Epistle of St. Peter, which in some points it closely resembles.
The general characteristic by which it is distinguished from these
Epistles is its Jewish tone of thought, style and doctrine. In style
it reminds one now of the Proverbs, now of the stern denuncia-
tions of the prophets, now of the parables in the Gospels. It has
scarcely any direct reference to Christ, who is indeed only
named twice.l In commending the duty of patience (V. 7—11)‚
the writer refers, with the Psalmist (cxxvi. 6), to the example
of the husbandman, and to Job and the prophets of the Old
Testament: if he alludes to our Lord at all, he only does so
obscurely in ver. 6 ‘ye killed the just3 he doth not resist y0u';
