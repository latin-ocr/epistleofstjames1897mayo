St. Paul says that three years after his conversion, probably about sgilssftil‘gljeh
the year 38 A.D.‚ he went from Damascus to Jerusalem and stayed an<1p¹stfct⁸⁵0f

with Peter fifteen days, seeing no other apostle but only 5611165 the 'ssssssssffi’gff

Lord's brother. This is quite in accordance with what we read in cliii-{¹31⁰ at
the Acts xii. 17, where Peter, on his escape from prison (AD. 44), aemam&
is recorded to have gone to the house of Mary the mother of Mark‚
and desired that the news of his escape might be sent to 5611165
and the brethren. In Gal. ii. 1-10 St. Paul describes a later visit to
Jerusalem aster an interval of fourteen years, 220. about A.D. 51. In
this visit the leaders of the Church, J 611165, Peter and John
(Le. ver. 9), after hearing his report of his first missionary journey‚
signified their approval of his work and ‘gave right hands of
fellowship,' agreeing that Paul and Barnabas should preach to the
Gentiles and they themselves to the circumcision. In verses 11—14
of the same chapter Peter's inconsistency in regard to eating with
the Gentiles at Antioch is explained by the arrival of certain from
5611165, πρὸ τοῦ «γὰρ ἐλθεῖν τινὰς ἀπὸ Ἰακώβου μετὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν
συνήσθιεν· ὅτε δὲ ἦλθον, ὑπέστελλεν καὶ ἀφώριζεν ἑαυτὸν φοβού-
’μενος τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς This second visit is more fully described
in Acts xv, 4-29, where 5 611165 appears as President of the Council
held to consider how far the Gentile Christians should be required
to conform to the customs of the Jews. It is 5 611165 who sums up
the discussion, and proposes the resolution which is carried, in the
words ἐνγὼ κρίνω μὴ παρενοχλεῖν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπιστρέφου-
σιν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν, κ.τ.λ.

It is important to notice that in his speech (ver. 14) Peter Remarkable

is called Symeon, a name never assigned to him elsewhere in a‘hetwqen
the Acts or in any part of the NT. except in 2 Pet. i. 1. &liniiliffeile
From this we gather that the actual words of the speaker are ἷὲξῖῗὲξῑῗῖ
recorded either in their original form or in a translation3 and Acts-xv.
it becomes thus a matter of interest to learn whether there is
any resemblance between the language of our Epistle and that
of the speech said to have been uttered by 5611165, and of the
circular containing the decree, which was probably drawn up by

him.l I cannot but think it a remarkable coincidence that, out of ’
