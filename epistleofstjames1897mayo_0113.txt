righteousness (ἐνεδυναμώθη τῇ πίστει δοὺς δόξαν τῷ (θεῷ καὶ
πληροφορηθεὶς ὅτι ὃ ἐπήγγελται δυνατός ἐστιν καὶ] ποιῆσαι. δι ὸ
ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην). Nor is 110 content
to leave to the Jews the exclusive boast 111 the futhei-houd of
Abraham (50111105 ii. 21): all who inherit Abraham’s saith arc sons
of Abraham (Gal. iii. 7, Rom. iv. 12), All this is most apposite 111
reference to the argument of 80. 50111105 and the use which might bc
made of it by Judaizers3 but put the case the other way, suppose
80. 50111105 to have written after 80. Pau13 and how inconceivable
is it that he should have made no attempt to guard his position
against such an extremely formidable attack 1 Again if 80. 5 ames
was really opposed to St. Paul and desired to maintain that man
was saved, not by grace, but by obedience to the law of Moses,
which was incumbent alike on Gentile and on 501ν, why has 110
never uttered a syllable on the subject, but confined himself to the
task of proving that a fait-h which bears no fruits is a dead saith 2
As I am on the subject of saith it may be convenient to mention
here that the treatment of this subject in the Epistle to the
Hebrews is such as to suggest that the writer was acquainted with
0111 Epistle, as well as with the Epistle to the Romans. The language
of 80. 5511105 was liable to be misunderstood because he does not
state distinctly what he means by ‘saith' In 0110 eleventh chap-
ter of the Hebrews the author begins with a definitior} of saith
and illustrates its power by a long series of examples. In ver. 6 he
explains why it is impossible to please God without saith. In
vi. 15 Abraham is said to have obtained the promise through his
patience (μακροθυμήσας); 111 xi· 8 1115 saith 15 evinced by his
obedience to the call to leave his own country and go he knew
not where3 in ver. 9 by his living as a stranger in the land of
promise awaiting the establishment of the City of God. 111 ver. 11
saith is said to have enabled 80110111 to conceive when she was past
age. In ver. 17 it 15 pointed out that the offering up of Isaac by
Abraham flowed naturally from his faith, that He who had given
the promise ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called' was able even to
raise him from the dead, In vv. 13-16 10 15 said of the patriarchs
collectively, that they died in saith not having received the pro—
mises but having saluted them afar off, desiring a better country,
that is an heavenly. Faith is exhibited throughout the chapter
not as in rivalry with works, as might 500111 to be the case in the
writings of 80. Paul and St. 50111105, 11110 as the cause and ground of
