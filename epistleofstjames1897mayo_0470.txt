be obtained (or pain avoided) by the commission of a wrong act.
At first the impulse is a blind instinctive movement, involuntary
and therefore innocent, but if unchecked it discovers a definite
aim, which it seeks to attain by uniting itself with thought and
will. Sin originates when we choose to dwell upon the thought
of the pleasure suggested, though knowing‚ or strongly suspecting,
that it cannot be lawfully obtained. The desire becomes stronger
by indulgence, the thought of sin ceases to shock as it becomes more
familiar, until at last that which had been long rehearsed in the
imaginationis enacted in real life. In most cases the commission of
the outward act is followed by something of shame or remorse, which
may lead to genuine repentance, but if the sting of conscience is dis-
regarded, the first wrong action is naturally followed by others, which
give rise to a sinful habit, and at length conscience is silenced, the will
is permanently enslaved, the moral nature is to all appearance dead3
and so the soul departs to the other world to receive the reward of the
things done in the body. The genesis of temptation is admirably
illustrated in the story of Macbeth. In the second scene we have the
picture of an innocent and laudable ambition. The interview with the
witches shows this ambition perilously sensitive to outward solicitation,
and already open to the suggestion of unlawful means for the attain-
ment of the coveted object, a suggestion seconded by his wife's direct
instigation, and supported by externa} circumstances, the nomination
of Malcolm as heir to the throne and the visit of Duncan. We have
then after many inisgivings the final resolve and the execution of the
murder: the consequent change from the noble Macbeth, whose nature
is full of the milk of human kindness and of whom it is said ‘ what
thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily,' to the bloodthirsty
tyrant of the later soenes. It is to be noticed that in Macbeth we are
always conscious of a background of hellish instigation. This does not
appear in the first chapter of St. JameS, but is recognized afterwards
in iii. 6 where the tongue is said to be set on fire of hell, iii. 15 where
false wisdom is described as devffish, iv. 7 where we are bidden to
submit ourselves to God and resist the devil‚ ‘the tempter' as he is
called by St. Paul, who makes use of our natural impulses to bring us
to ruin.

Here however a further difficulty arises, for the action of Satan is
sometimes said to be permitted by God, as in the temptation of J ob 3
at other times an action is attributed indifferently to Satan and to
God, as in the numbering of the people by David, which is said to be
instigated by God in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, by Satan in l Chron. xxi. 1 3 and
yet again God seems to be represented as the author of immoral or
irreligious conduct in man, as in Ex. ix, 16 ‘the Lord hardened the
heart of Pharaoh.' With regard to the first case the answer is simple :
Satan tempts with the design of inclucing J ob to give up his righteous-
ness and his trust in God: God permits the temptation, because He
knows the end will be to prove J ob's faith and confirm his righteous-
ness. It is fundamentally the case of those to whom St. J ames writes.
