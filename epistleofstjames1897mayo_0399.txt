(Neh. xiii. 25), and the imprecations in the Psalms. Are we then
to suppose that St. Jaines here attaches a special force to the words
καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ γεγονόταςΖ Does he mean by this, ‘ men transfor-med
into the divine image ’2 This seems precluded by a comparison of the
passages cited at the end of the preceding note, in which a similar
inference is drawn from man’s general relation to the Creator. Must
we then conclude that cursing in itself is here condemned as a
form, and that the worst form, of καταλαλιὰ and κρίσις (below iv. Ilm
So St. Paul, Rom. xii. 14 εὐλογεῖτε καὶ μὴ καταρᾶσθε, Cf, Luke Vi. 28.
Cursing will then be the overflow of the bitter water spoken of in ver.
11, ‘the water which causeth the curse ' (Numbers v. 18), a sign of the
ζῆλος πικρός which characterizes the wisdom of this world <below ver.
14). Nor is this view of· the wrongfulness of cursing unknown in the
O.T. : cf. Job xxxi. 29‚'30 (‘ neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by
wishing a curse to his, i.e. my enemy’s, soul 1> 3 it is the mark of the
wicked ‘chat ἇρᾶς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ’γέμει καὶ πικρίας, Ps. X. 7. But then,
why is not St. James content to condemn cursing in itself‘l Why does
he only condemn it when combined with what is good, blessing‘l It is
because ‘the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God’
(above i. 20), because ‘ bitterness proves that we are lying against the
truth’ (below v. 14), in the words of St. John (1 ep. iv. 20) because
‘ he that loveth not his brother cannot love God,' so that the mixture of
cursing proves the unreality of the blessing, cf. Matt. xii. 34, ib. V. 23, 24.

ἐξέρχεται εὐλογία καὶ κατάρα] Where there is one predicate to several
connected subjectS‚ of which the nearest to the verb is 111 the singular
number, the predicate, if it precedes the subjects, may itself be in the
singular, as though it referred only to the nearest subject: cf. 1 Tim.
Vi. 4 ἐξ ὧν γίνεται φθόνος, ἔρις, βλασφημίαι, Apoc. iX. 17, ἐκ τῶν στομάτων

οὐ χρὴ ταῦτα. οὕτως vivan-OQ] χρή not found elsewhere in N.T.‚ occurs
in Prov. xxv. 27 τιμᾶν χρὴ λόγους ἐνδόξους. It is about equivalent to
ὀφείλομεν, weaker than δεῖ, which properly implies not merely what
ought to be, but what must be, though at times it comes very near to
χρή, as in hIark xiii. 14 ἑστὼς ὅπου οὐ δεῖ, 2 Tim. ii. 24 δοῦλον Κυρίου οὐ
δεῖ μάχεσθαι. Some hold that οὕτως 16 pleonastic with ταῦτα, merely
adding emphasis, as where it marks the apodosis (Winer, p. 678):
should it not rather be taken as summing up what was said before of
the manner in which the blessings and curses are uttered with an
unbridled tongue under the violence of passion? I think we cannot
assume that St. James would have condemned such anathem-as as we
find in 1 Cor. xvi. 22, Gal. i. 8. Dr. Plummer compares Numb. xxiii.
8 ‘ How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed‘!
