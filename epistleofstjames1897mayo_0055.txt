of Mary bya miraculous conception. Joseph is told that ‘his 11111110
13 10 be called J esus, because he shall save his people from their
sins.' Mary is told 111 addition that ‘he shall be called the Son of
the Highest, and that the Lord God shall give him the throne of
his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for
ever.' There is surely nothing in these words which would ‹lisclose
the Christian mystery ‘God manifest in the flesh.’ They point to a
greater Moses, or David, or Solonion, or Samuel. Mary's hymn of , What

praise is founded on the recollection of Hannah's exultation at the *Essigiiiin'*
fulfilment of prophecy in the birth of her son. Her mind would ffflirsssssssylf

naturally turn to other miraculous births, to that of Isaac under -Josevlt
the old dispensation, to that now impending in the case of her
cousin Elizabeth. And as there was nothing in the announcement
made to them which could enable them to realize the astounding
truth that he who was 10 be born of Mary was VERY GOD OF VERY
GOD, so there is nothing in the Subsequent life of Mary which
would lead 113 to believe that she, any more than his Apostles, had
realized it before his Resurrection. On the contrary, it is plain
that such a belief fully realized would have made it impossible for
her to fuffil, I do not say her duties towards her husband, but her
‹luties towards the Lord himself during his infancy and childhood.
It is hard enough even now to hold together the ideas of the
Humanity and Divinity of Christ without doing violence to either3
but to those who knew him in the flesh we may safely say it was
impossible until the Comforter had come and revealed it unto them.
As to what should be the relations between the husband and wife
after the birth of the promised Child there is one thing we may be
sure of, viz. that these would be determined not by personal con-
siderations, but either by immediate inspiration, as the journey to
Egypt and other events had been, or, in the absence of this, by the
one desire to do what they believed to be best for the bringing up
of the Ohild entrusted to 1110111. We can imagine their feeling it
to be a duty to abstain from bringing other children into the
world, in order that they might devote themselves more exclusively

idealized Solomon. Again (p. lxii.) they remark, ‘it is a matter not without interest

and iinportance that our Psakns, which stand closest of all extant ι101111311 religious

poetry to the Christian era, are 30 conspicuously similar to the songs contained 111

the opening chapters of St. Luke's Gospel.' The editors appear even to suggest the

possibility that the so-called Psalms of solomon may have been written by the

author of the Nunc dimittis (p. lix. n.). In Justin's dialogue (§49) Trypho asserts
ἰ that the general belief of the Jews 13 that Christ would be merely man.
