AUTHENTICITY OF THE EPISTLE xlix

Epistles styled Catholic is said to be by J ames the Lord's brother.
But I must remark that it is held by some to be spurious.
Certainly not many old writers have mentioned it, as neither have
they the Epistle of J ude, which is also one of the seven so-callcd
Catholic Epistles ' (ib. ii. 23). His own practice, however, betrays·
no suspicion of its genuineness, as he not only recognizes it as an
authority (Eccl. leeol. ii. 25 οὐκ εἰδῶς ὅτι καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια πιστεύ-
ουσι καὶ φρίττουσι, ib. iii. :2 καθ’ ὃ λέλεκται ἐν ἑτέροις, ἐξομο-
λογεῖσθε ἀλλήλοις τὰς ἁμαρτιάς) but in one passage quotes J ames
iv. 11 as Scripture (Oomm. in Psalm. p. 648 Montfi), in another
quotes J ames v. 13 as spoken by the holy Apostle (ib. p. 247).

The doubt as to the canonicity of the Epistle in early times
is sufficientiy shown by its omission from some of the early
versions and catalogues of Sacros] Books. Thus it is omitted
from the earliest extant catalogue, contained in what is known as
the Muratorian Fragment, of which Bp. Westcott says that it
may be regarded as ‘a summary of the opinion of the Western
Church on the Canon shortly after the middle of the second·
century,'1 Of the disputed books this contains two Epistles of St.
John, the Apocalypse, and Jude, omitting Hebrews, James, and
Peter 1, 2. It has been suggested, however, that there is a corrup-
tion, in the text, where it now speaks of the Apocalypse of Peter
(Apocalypse etiam Johanm's et Petri tantum recipimus quam quidam
ecc nostris [egli in ecclesia nolunt), and that the original Greek may
have been something of this sort: καὶ ἡ ἀποκάλυψις δὲ Ἰωάννου
καὶ Πέτρου [ἐπιστολὴ μία, ἣν] μόνην ἀποδεχόμεθα· [ἔστι δὲ καὶ
ἑτέρα] ἧν τινες τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀναὙινώσκεσθαι ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ οὐ θέλου-
σιν. Bp. Westcott remarks that the canon of the old Latin version
used by Tertullian corresponds with the Muratorian in omitting the
Epistle of St. J ames, the second of St. Peter, and Hebrews.2 The
Canon Mommsenianus, first published by Th. Mommsen in 1886 from
a MS. of the tenth century, containing the Liber Generationis attri—
buted to Hippolytus, appears to belong to the year 359 A.D., and·
to have been written in Africa.3 It contains all our canonical books
with the exception of James, J ude, and Hebrews; but the mention

¹ Dr. Sanday places it at the end of the century (Empositor, 1891, p. 408).
2 Tertullian, it is true, refers to the Hebrews (De Pudic. c. 20), but not as

canonical or authoritative ; just in the same way as he refers to St. James in the

passages quoted below.

Books’ (Studia Biblaka, iii. 217 foll.).
