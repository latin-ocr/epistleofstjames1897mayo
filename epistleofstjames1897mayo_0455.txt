v 17, 18] NOTEs 175

ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς τοῦ ξυμπαρακομισθῆναι); but it is used also to denote the
consequence of an action, as in Acts iii. 12 ὡς πεποιηκόσι τοῦ περιπατεῖν
αὐτόν, and even for the simple infinitive, when it stands as subject of
the sentence, as in Luke xvii. 1 ἀνενὸεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ
ἐλθεῖν, Acts x. 25 ἐγένετο τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν τὸν Πέτρον, see XVineig p. 408 foll.
The verb βρέχει is here used, like ὕει, without a subject, as in Luke
xvii. 29 : we have the personal use in Matt. v. 45 (ὁ Θεὸς) βρέχει ἐπὶ
δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους.

As regards the facts referred to, we hear nothing of this prayer in
the O.T., unless the expression ‘before whom I stand’ (in 1 Kings
xvii. 1) may be interpreted to mean ‘ stand in prayer ’ as in J er. xv.
1, cf. Gen. xviii. 22, XiX. 17. The duration of the drought here
given is the same as that in Luke iv. 25, which is also found in
the Rabbinical tractate Jalkut Simeoni quoted by Schegg after
Surenhusius; but in 1 Kings xviii. 1 it is said ‘after many days the
word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying...I will
send rain upon the earth.' We are not told from what point the
third year is dated, if it is from the commencement of his sojourn
with the widow, as is generally supposed 3 and if the expression ‘ end
of the days' in 1 Kings xvii. 7 ((11) came to pass at the end of the days
that the brook dried up ⁷) is to be understood, as in other places, of a
year or more (see Keil ’ἰιι loc. and on xviii. 1, who compares Lev. XXV.
29, 1 Sam. xxvii. 7, Jud. xvii. 1Ο); then the cessation of the drought
would take place in the fourth year from its commencement, and
Jewish tradition would naturally fix on the middle of the fourth year,
as giving the half of the symbolical number, which is so prominent in
the prophecies of Daniel and in Apoc. xi. 3-9 (where it is said that the
two witnesses ‘ have power to shut the heaven ἵνα μὴ ὑετὸς βρέχῃ during
the days of their prophecy,' i.e. 1260 days: 3} years). Others suppose
the calculation to include the dry season preceding the first failure of
the regular periodical rains. It is simply a question as to the origin
of a Jewish tradition which undoubtedly existed at the time of the
Christian era, and which was probably excogitated by the early
rabbinical interpreters. In the fourth book of Esdras (vii. 39) Elijah
is cited as an example of intercession pro his qui pluviam acceperunt ez
pro mov-tuo ut viveret.

ἐπὶ τῆς fila] Merely filling up the idea of ἔβρεξεν as in Gen. vii. 12
ἐγένετο ὁ ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, 1 Kings xvii. 7, see above v. 5.

18, πάλιν προσηύξατο] As shown by his attitude (1 Kings xviii. 42),
for which cf. Neh. viii. 6.

ὁ οὐρανὸς ὑετὸν ἕδωκεν.] The phrase ὑ. διδ. is used of God in 1 Kings
xviii. 1, 1 Sam. xii. 17, Acts xiv. 17 οὐρανόθεν ὑετοὺς διδούς. Josephus
(Ant. xiv. 2. 1) tells a similar anecdote of Onias (13.0. 64) δίκαιος ἀνὴρ
καὶ θεοφιλὴς ὃς ἀνομβρίας ποτὲ οὔσης ηὔξατο τῷ Θεῷ...καὶ ὃ Θεὸς ὗσεν, and
Epiphanius (p. 1046) of James himself, ποτὲ ἀβροχίας γενομένης ἐπῇρε
τὰς χεῖρας εἷς οὐρανὸν καὶ προσηύξατο καὶ εὐθὺς ὃ οὐρανὸς ἔδωκεν ὗετόν.
Clem. Al. (Saroni. vi. 3‚·p. 753 P.) cites the legendary story of Aeacus
(Paus. ii. 28, p. 179) to the same effect, as being derived from the
narrative of the miraculous rain sent in answer to Samuel's prayer
