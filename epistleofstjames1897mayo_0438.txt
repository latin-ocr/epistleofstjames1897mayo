158 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

Possibly the ‚Jews of the Dispersion may have been less familiar with
the details 010111Ί Lord's life, than with the books of the OT. which
were read to them in the synagogue every Sabbath day. The example
of the prophets is referred to in other parts of the N.T., as in Matt. v.
12, xxiii. 34, Acts vii. 52, esp. Heb. xi. Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses,
Isaiah, Jeremiah are preeminent patterns of endurance. Cf. Isa. l.
5 foll„ Lam. 111. 27 foll.‚ Heb. Vi. 12 μιμηταὶ τῶν διὰ πίστεως καὶ μακρο-
θυμίας κληρονομούντων τὰς ἐπαγγελίας. In Heb. xiii. 7 μνημονεύετε τῶν
ἡγουμένων ὑμῶν. . ,ὧν ἀναθεωροῦντες τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς μιμεῖσθε τὴν
πίστιν, it is possible that there is allusion to the life and death of St.
James himself.

ἐλάλησαν ἐν τῷ ὁνόματι.] Honoured as they were, they still had to
bear persecution. Speaking ‘in the name' means speaking as repre—
sentatives of Him who sent them, cf. below v. 14. The simple dative
is found Matt. vii. 22, Jer. xliv. (li.) 16 ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησας πρὸς ἡμᾶς
ὀνόματι Κυριόυ. This approaches the force of ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι (depending
on his name, i.e. through his power), which occurs both in N.T., as in
Acts iv. 17, 18, and in classical writers, as Dem. Lept. 495. 7, Isae. 58.
28 and 85. 3 with Sch'omann's n. Diodorus xviii. 57 has γράψας
ἐπιστολὴν ἐκ τοῦ τῶν βασιλέων ὀνόματος.

11. μακαρίζομεν τοὺς ὑπομείναντας.1 AS in i. 12, and Dan. Xii. 12, Of. Matt.
xxiv. 13 ὃ δὲ ὑπομείνας εἷς τέλος οὗτος σωθήσεται, 4 Maec. vii. 22 εἰδὼς ὅτι
τὸ διὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν πάντα πόνον ὑπομένειν μακάριόν ἐστιν. Ὑπομονή is
found in connexion with μακροθυμία 2 Cor. vi. 4 ff.‚ Col. i. 11, 2 Tim.
iii. 10.

Ἰώβ.] J ob is not an example of what we should call patience except
in his first acceptance of calamity (i. 21, ii. 10). We should rather say
that his complaint in ch. iii., his indignation against his friends for
their want of saith in him, his agony at the thought that God had
forsaken him, were symptoms of an extremely sensitive, vehement,
impatient character, which has very little either of Stoic ἀπάθεια or of
Christian πραΰτης, but excites our admiration by its passionate outbursts
of exalted feeling. The word means however endurance, and may well
be applied to the persistent trust in God shown in ch. xiii. 10, 15, xvi.
19-21, xix. 25 foll. It corresponds to ἐκαρτέρησε, used of Moses, Heb.
xi. 25. For the reference to Job, cf. Tanchuma 29. 4 ap. Schoettgen
ll. H. 1009 foll. si pauper stat in tentatione et non recalcitrat, ille duplum
accipiet in mundo futuro. Ea: cujus exemplo hoc addiscis? Exemplo
Jobz· qui tentatus esc in hoc mundo, Deus vero duplum ipsi reddidit.

ἠκούσατε] So in the Ser-mon on the Mount ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρήθη. It
is properly used of oral instruction 111 the synagogue. The aor. here
must be translated, as in many other instances, by the Eng. perfect.1

τὸ τέλος Κυρίου εἴδετε] ‘ You are acquainted with the story and have
seen in it how God makes all turn out for good.' Alf. reads ἴδετε with
AB2, translating ‘ see also,' which gives a very uncouth sentence, and
would imply that they could have heard the story without seeing
