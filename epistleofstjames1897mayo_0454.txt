174 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ὀμ. is used by Paul of himself and Barnabas to the people of Lystra,
by the Fathers of Christ (οὍ or. Euseb H.E. i. 2, cf. Heb. iv. 15), in 4
Maec. xii. 13 to show the atr oeity of per secution οὐκ ῇδεσθης ἅνθρωπος
ὢν Τοὺς ΟμΟῑΟΊΤαθΕῖς Καὶ ἐκ Τῶν αυτῶν ὙΕῪΟΙΙΟΤας σΤΟιΧΕίωὶΙ ’γλωΤΤΟΤΟμ-ἣσαι-
It was necessary for the writer to insist on the resemblance between us
and Elijah because of the exaggerated ideas entertained of the latter
at that time (see Sir. xlviii. 1-12) z ‘ Such potency of prayer is not out
of our reach, for Elijah possessed it, though he was partaker of human
weakness.' Compare Peter’s words to Cornelius, Acts X. 26, and Anton.
Vi. 19 μὴ, εἴ τι αὐτῷ σοι δυσκαταπόνητον, τοῦτο ἀνθρώπῳ ἀδύνατον ὑπολαμβά-
νειν, ἀλλ’ εἴτι ἀνθρώπῳ δυνατὸν καὶ οἰκεῖον, τοῦτο καὶ σεαυτῷ ἐφικτὸν νόμιζε

ciple (ὢν) see WViner 542-544 and above iii. 5 μικρὸν μέλος ἐστὶ καὶ

προσευχῇ προσ-ηὔξατο.] For examples of similar reduplication see Luke

ἀπειλησώμεθα, ib V. 28 παραγγελία παρηγγείλαμεν, ab. xxiii. 14 ἀναθεματι
ἀνεθεματίσαμεν( εαυτούς, 2 Pet. iii. 3 ἐν ἐμπαιγμονῇ ἐμπαῖκται, EXOd. iii.

from classical writers, in some of which the dative is added for preci-
sion, as in Dem. 1002. 12 γάμῳ γεγαμηκώς qui rite eostf'ecit nuptias, but
in others has an intensive force, as Plato Symp. 195 φεύγειν φυγῇ, com-
pare such phrases as κακὸς κακῶς, andin Lat. occidione occidere, curriculo
currere. I cannot understand what should lead De Wette, Hofmann,
Huther, Erdmann to deny this intensive force which belongs to
reduplication in all languages. The last translates ‘in einem Gebet
betete er,' and says by this is expressed ‘nicht der Charakter der
Ernstlichkeit und Kraftigkeit, sondern die That des Gebets‚⁷ and so, Ι
suppose, Alford ‘he pragsecl with prayer (made it a special matter of
prayer, not prayecl earnestlgs. This adoption of the Hebrew idiom
merely brings out more forcibly the idea of the verb)‚' though liis
meaning is far from clear. A similar intensive phrase is formed by
the use of the participle, as in 1 Sam. xxvi. ‘25 ποιῶν ποιήσεις, δυνάμενος
δυνήσῃ, PS. cxviii. 18 παιδεύων ἐπαίδευσε, Jer. iii. 22 ἐπιστραφῆτε ἐπιστρέ-
φοντες, Lam. i. 2 κλαίουσα ἔκλαυσεν.

τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι] Τ110 genitive of the infinitive' 1s used to express the
purpose of an action in classical wliteis, as in Thuc. i. 4 τὸ ληστικὸν
καθῄρει ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἴέναι αὐτῷ, but the use
is much extended in the Hellenistic Greek. Thus it is found not only
after verbs immediately expressive of design, as here and in Isa. v. 6
ταῖς νεφέλαις ἐντελοῧμαι τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι εἷς αὐτὸν ὑετόν, and in the
Byzantine writers, as Malalas XiV. 357 ᾐτήσατο ἡ Αὕγουστα τὸν βασιλέα
τοῦ κατελθεῖν εἷς τοὺς ἁγίους τόπους (cf. Thuc. viii. 40 ἀγγελίαν ἔπεμπον
