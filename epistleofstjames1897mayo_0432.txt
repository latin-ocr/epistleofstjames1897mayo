152 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἐπαμήσαιο δ’ ἂν μόνον, ἔφη, τὴν γῆν, ἦ καὶ σάξαις ἂν εὖ μάλα περὶ τὸ φυτόν ,·
ib. xvii. 13 ἀντιπροσαμησάμενοι τὴν ’γῆν τῷ ἐψιλωμένῳ τὰς ῥίζας, of heaping
earth on a corpse Herod. viii. 24 τάφρους ὀρυξάμενος ἔθαψε γῆν
ἐπαμησάμενος ; 111 its commonest sense of reaping or mowing, getting in
the harvest, the active voice is used, as in Homer Il. xviii. 551 ἔριθοι
ἤμων ὀξείας δρεπάνας ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες, ib. XXiv. 451 λαχνήεντ’ ὄροφον
(reeds) λειμωνόθεν ἀμήσαντες, Herod. Vi. 28 ἀμ. σῖτον, Arist). Eq. 392 ἀμ.
θέρος. The word θερίζειν is rather more common for reaping and
harvesting‚ and is given as a synonym of ἀμᾶν by Hesych. Both are
used alike of the reaping of corn (ἀμ. in Lev. XXV, 11, Deut. xxiv, 19,
Isa. xvii. 5) and the mowing of grass (θερ. in Ps. cxxix. 7). Both are
used also in a metaphorica] sense of cutting sheer off, as in Hes. leeoy.
181 (of Oronos mutilating his father) ἤμησε, Soph. Aj. 239 (of Ajax)
γλῶσσαν ῥίπτει θερίσας.

τὰς χώρας ὑμῶν.] Used here of a field, plot of ground, like χωρίον in
Acts i. 18, iv. 34, xxviii. 7, and in classical writers. So we find Luke
xxi. 21 οἱ ἐν ταῖς χώραις, ib. xii. 16 ἀνθρώπου τινὸς εὐφόρησεν ἡ χώρα,
John iv. 35 θεάσασθε τὰς χώρας ὅτι λευκαί εἶσι πρὸς θερισμόν, Evang.
Thomae C. 12 ἵνα σπείρῃ σῖτον εἷς τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν. In Amos iii. 9, X.
11 it stands where the A.V. has ‘palaces' : Josephus (Ant. vii. 8. 5)
uses it of Joab's field, called μερίς 2 Sam. xiv. 30.

ὁ ἀφυστερημένος ἀφ’ ὑμῶν.] ‘Which is kept back by you,' ‘ comes too
late from you.' The verb is only found here in N.T. In Classical
writers ὑστερέω and its compounds are intransitive, as also in Sir. xiV.
14 μὴ ἀφυστερήσης ἀπὸ ἀγαθῆς ἡμέρας ‘ be nob labe for a feasb,' Heb. Χ11.
15 ὑστερῶν ἀπὸ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Θεοῦ ‘falling short of,' Luke xxii. 25 μή
τινος ὑστερήσατε ; ‘did ye come short in anything'l ', Sir. xxvi. 19 ἀνὴρ
πολεμιστὴς ὑστερῶν δι’ ἔνδειαν. Of the transitive use we have an example
in Neh. ix. 20 τὸ μάννα σου οὐκ ἀφυστέρησας ἀπὸ στόματος αὐτῶν. The
passive occurs Diod. xviii. 71 ὑστεροῦντο τῆς χρείας, Eurip. Iple. A. 1203
παιδὸς ὖστερήσομαι (2), 2 Cor. xi. 8 ‘ when I was in want (ὑστερήθεις) Ι was
not a burden on any man,' Heb. xi. 37 ὑστερούμενοι, θλιβόμενοι, Luke xv.
14, 1 Cor. viii. 8, Phil. iv. 12, Sir. Xi. 11 ἔστι σπεύδων καὶ τόσῳ μᾶλλον ὓστε-
ρεῖται. Some take ἀπό = ὑπὸ comparing Luke XVii. 25 ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι ἀπὸ
τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης. In both cases I should prefer to explain it as denoting
not properly the agent, but the quarter from which the action proceeds.
I cannot agree with Huther, Lange and Alford in connecting it with
κράζει ‘ cries from your coffe1·s.⁷ The law required the prompt payment
of the workman, Deut. xxiV. 15 αὐθημερὸν ἀποδώσεις τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ· οὐκ
ἐπιδύσετοιι ὃ ἥλιος ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, ὅτι πένης ἐστὶ καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔχει τὴν ἐλπίδα
καὶ καταβοήσεται κατὰ σοῦ πρὸς Κύριον καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία, Levit.
xix. 13, Jer. xxii. 13, Mal. iii. 5, Prov. iii. 27, 28, Sir. xxxi. (xxxiV.)
22 ἐκχέων αἷμα ὁ ἀποστερῶν μισθὸν μισθίου, Tobib iv. 14, Hermas
Vis. 111. 9 βλέπετε ὑμεῖς οἶ γαυρούμενοι ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ ὑμῶν μήποτε
στενάξουσιν οἱ ὑστερούμενοι καὶ ὁ στεναγμὸς αὐτῶν ἀναβήσεται πρὸς τὸν
Κύριον. Immediately afterwards he speaks of the ἰός received into
their heart.

κράζει] The withholding of wages is one of the four sins which are
said to cry to heaven. See Deut. Z.c., Gen. iv. 10 thy brother’s blood
