tained in all the other Epistles put together—is it not probablc
that he may have also preserved sayings of our Lord not rc-
corded in the Gospels? Dr. A. Resch, in his collection of such
unrecorded sayings,1 includes several verses from our Epistle
which are mentioned 111 my note on i. 12: ‘'Blessed 15 ‘the man that
endureth temptation: for when he hath been appi 11 ed 110 511111

This is repeated 111 nearly the same words 111 ii. 5, ‘Did not God
choose them that are poor to the world to be rich in saith and heirs
of the kingdom which he promised to them that 10110 him ἲ ’ and in
2 Tim. iv. 8, 1 Ρο13. V. 4, Apoc. ii. 10. Beyond this passage, however,
I am not satisfied that any of those quoted by Resch are certainly
to be included in 13110 Agyraplm, though it can hardly be doubted
that there must be other echoes of Christ's words in the Epistle,
which we are now unable to identffy, as they do not occur in the
Gospels and are not expressly ascribed 130 Η1111 either by St. J ames
or by any early writer. Dr. Resch seems to regard the frequency
of quotation by Subsequent writers as a proof that the passage was
originally uttered by Christ, but is not this to assume that it
was impossible for a text from St. James to get into general
circulation ’.ἱ

Leaving this subordinate point, the facts we have been consider· Ροέ5 515111

definite proof of agreement from the Epistle written by St. J ames
long after he had enrolled himself among the disciples, we may
perhaps gather from its silence a confirmation of what we might
have suspected 011 general grounds, that one of his character of
mind would find a difficulty in accepting some of the utterances of
Christ. ‘Before Abraham was, I am? ‘ Except ye eat the fiesh
