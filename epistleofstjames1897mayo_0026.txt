vi IN TRODUCTION

of the Epistle is or, to allow for a moment the possibility of its
not being genuine, wishes to be understood as being, the President
of the Ohurch at Jerusalem, and the brother of the Lord.l We
have now to investigate the meaning of this last 6111116551011.2 Ι5
it to be understood literally of half-brothers of the Lord, sons of
Mary his mother and of Joseph his reputed father (the Helvidian
view)‘.2 Or is it to be understood of foster-brothers, sons of his
reputed father by a former wife (the Epiphaniau view)? Or is it
to be understood of the cousins of the Lord, sons of Clopas or
Alphaeus‚ the husband of his mother's sister, who bore the same
name as herself (the Hieronymian view)? It may be well first
to bring together the passages bearing 00 this subject in the
Gospels, and then to examine them more caresully in reference to
the three theories above stated. I quote from the RV.

Matt. i. 25. Joseph . . . took unto him his wife and knew her
not til] she had brought forth a son.

Luke ii. 7. She brought forth 1161 first-born son.

John ii. 12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he and
his 'mother and his brethren and his disciples: and there they
abode not many days.

Mark vi. 1-6. And he cometh into his own country; and his
disciples follow him. And when the sabbath was come, he began
to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were aston-
ished, saying . . . Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary‚ and
brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not
his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him. And

¹ Ι have made no reference to the T'ubingen theory which supposes the Acts to be
a Temlenz-schrzfl written with the view of minimizing the differcnce between St. Paul
and St. James, (1) because I do not see that it in any way affects my argument, unless
it should be maintained that the writer of the Acts had our Epistle before him and
intentionally imitated its language, which would give an even stronger support to
my argument from a different point of view 3 and (2) because the theory itself seems
to me by this time exploded.

2 In the discussion which follows I have had constantly before me Bp. Lightfoot's
dissertation on the Brethren of the Lord, admirable alike for thoroughness, clearness,
and fairness, which is contained in his Galatiam (ioth ed, pp. 252—291). Ι have
also consulted Credner’s Είηῖσίίηηῃ in d. N. T„ Laurent's Neutest. Studien, Mill's
Pantheistic Principlc& Part ΙΙ. pp. 220-316, aud the articles ‘ Maria’ and ‘Jakobus'
in Herzog's Encgycl. f. prot. leeol. I should have been glad to put the question
aside with a simple reference, but I think there are some considerations which have
not been sufficiently attended to, and that the Epistle gains an added interest from
what I hold to be the right solution of the difficulty. [Since this was written I
have read Canon Farrar's able discussion of the subject in his Early Days of
Christianity, ch. xix„ and Bungener's Rome ct Za Bible, both of whom take the same
view as 1 have done]
