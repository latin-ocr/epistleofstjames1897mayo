110 THE EPISTLE OF sT. JAMES

facilitates the transposition of the predicate. We may suppose that
the form of the sentence as it first occurred to the writer was ἡ γλῶσσα
πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίαςε and that for the sake of clearness he added
the remaining words.

The next difficulty is the meaning of κόσμος here. Isidore of Pelu-
sium (fl. 400 A.D.), followed by the Greek commentators, mentions
two meanings (1) ‘orna'ment‚ ² ἐγκαλλώπισμα δοκεῖ τῆς ἀδικίας, because
the tongue κοσμεῖ τὴν ἀδικίαν διὰ τῆς τῶν ῥητόρων εὗγλώττου δεινότη-
τοςε 50⁶·Elsne1‚WVetstein, Semicr, Storr, Ewald‚ and others3 (2) ‘ the
wicked wor'ld : at least this seems to be intended by the somewhat
obscure expressions πῦρ ἐστι, πλῆθος ἀδικως κατακαίουσα, and κόσμος ἐστὶ
τῆς ἀδικίας, οἱονεὶ πρὸς τὸν συρφετώδη ὄχλον καὶ δημώδη ἐκφερομένη καὶ
βλέπουσα, with which apparently should be connected the sentence just
below, ταύτῃ ’γὰρ ἀλλήλοις κοινωνοῦμεν τῶν ἑαυτῶν νοημάτων. The majority
however ot' modern commentators follow the Vulgate ‘universitas
iniquitatis’ (3), thus explained by Bede, ‘Quia cuncta fere facinora
per eam aut concinnantur . . . (cut pato-amm· . . . aut dqfendwzturs
So Erasmus, Calvin, Corn. ἐι Lapide, Schneckenburger‚ Rern, De W'ette,
XViesingeiz Alford, Beyschlag, Erdmann. The objection to (3) is, that
St. James elsewhere only uses the word κόσμος in a bad sense (i. 27
ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου, ii. 5, iv. 4 ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου ἔχθρα
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστίν) 5 that only one example in all Greek literature is adduced
for the meaning ⁴ totality‚' viz, Prov. xvii. 6 τοῦ πιστοῦ ὅλος ὃ κόσμος
τῶν χρημάτων, τοῦ δὲ ἀπίστου οὐδὲ ὀβολός, if indeed this should not be
rather understood literally of the inanimate world, as consisting of
things which can be used and enjoyed. Lastly, the article seems
scarcely consistent with this interpretation. ⁴ A world of cares ’ is a
natural expression for many cares 5 but if we say ‘the world of care‚⁷
we are understood to predicate something about the world itself‚
Schegg' s interpletation‚ ‘the spheie or domain of iniquityss is, I think,
an improvement on (3) as fai as sense goes, but it is not the natur· tl
meaning of κόσμος The objections stated above are also applicable ln
part to (l). It is moreover a very halsh expression to call the tongue
⁶ the ornament of injustice’ because it iscapable of being used to give
a colour to injustice 5 and it falls flatly after the stronger word ‘ fireJ

Putting aside the commentators‚ if we read the words simply we can
hardly fail to be reminded of the similar expressions in Luke xvi. 8, 9
τὸν οἰκονόμον τῆς ἀδικίας, τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας, where τῆς ἀδικίας is
qualitative, as is shown by the parallel expression in ver. ll, τῷ ἀδίκῳ
μαμωνᾷ (cf. 1. 17 above). So Enoch 48. 7 ⁶ He preserveth the lot of the
righteous, because they have hated this world of unriyhteousnesss
CT. compares Jerome Pelags. Π. 6 seculum illud iniquitatis. The
meaning of the phrase will §then be ‘in our microcosm the tongue
represents or constitutes the unrighteous world ⁷ which is probably the
meaning of the version in the Speculum, mundus iniquitatis per lin-
quam constat in membris vestris .· cf. l John v. 19 ὃ κόσμος ὅλος ἐν τῷ
πονηρῷ κεῖται, and below iv, 4.1 In the same way it might be said

1 [I think the force of the expression is better brought out if we explain τ. ἀδικίας
as a possessive genitive, ‘ the world which is under the dominion of unrighteousness,⁷
