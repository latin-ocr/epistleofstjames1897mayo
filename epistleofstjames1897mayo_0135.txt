TO WHOM THE EPISTLE Is ADDRESSED cxv

a distinct reference to that of St. James, which in some respects
served as a model for his own. It seems natural therefore to
suppose that one reason why it was addressed to these particular
provinces of the Diaspora was that they were less likely to be ac—
quainted with the Epistle of St. J ames than the provinces omitted.
It is also probable that the name Diaspora would be understood to
refer, in the first instance, to the original Eastern Diaspom, settled
in Babylon and Mesopotamia, and extending as far as the eastern
and northern hordeis of Palestine. Josephus tells us that his
History of tlte Jewisla l'ch‘ was first written in Aramaic and
addressed τοῖς ἄνω βαρβάροις, whom he afterwards explains to
be the dwellers in Parthia, Babylonia, Arabia, Adiabene, and the
countries on the other side of the Euphrates (B. J. Prooem. i. 2),
but that subsequently he translated it into Gleek for the benefit
of the Romans (Ap. i. 9). It is also noticeable that these eastern
provinces are the ones first named in the list given of the foreign
Jews who were present at the feast of Pentecost (Acts ii. 9—11).
We know that there were Christians in Damascus and Antioch
at a very early period (Acts ix. 2, 10, 14, 19, 25, xi. 19—-21), as
well as in Cyprus and Phoenicia (Acts iv. 36, xi. 19, 20). St.
Peter writes from Babylon (v. 13), which should perhaps be under-
stood literally of the city on the Euphrates and the surrounding
district. An early legend represents a King* of Edessa corre-
sponding with our Lord and welcoming the mission of the apostle
Thaddaeus (Euseb. II. E. i. 13).

We will now see what more is to be learnt in regard to the
readers of the Epistle from the Epistle itself. James writes to them
as being himself a servant of Jesus Christ (i. 1), and he assumes
that they hold the saith of Christ (ii. 1) and recognize that they
⁴ are no longer under a yoke of bondage but under the perfect law of
liberty (i. 25, ii. 12). They are mixed up however with men who
are not only unbelievers but who blaspheme the name of Christ
and persecute the believers (ii. 6, 7). The believers themselves
are mostly poor (ii. 5) 3 the few rich belonging to their body (i. 10)
are in danger of falling away through covetousness, worldliness
and pride (iv. 3—6, 13—16). The rich generally appear as perse-
cutors and oppressors, keeping back the hire of their labourers,
killing innocent men, themselves the slaves of lust and luxury,
fattening themselves in the day of slaughter (ii. 6, 7, v. 3—6).
