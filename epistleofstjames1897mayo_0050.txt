xxx INTRODUOTION

μνηστευθείσης not γαμηθείσης, and argues that a just man, such as Joseph is
described to be, one too who is still honoured as a pattern of virginity, could
never have regarded as his wise her who was the chosen vessel of the Holy
Ghost. The Holy Famssy returned from Egypt when Jesus was four years
old; and not long afterwards Joseph died. If 116 had been still alive or if
Mary had had children of her own, would J esus have entrusted her to
John at the Crucifixion? And why is she called mother of John 2 Surely
because she is μήτηρ ἀρχηγὸς τῆς παρθενίας. Nothing is said as to the Virgin's
death, but it does not seem that she accompanied St. John to Ephesus. What
does this silence intimate [l I tremble almost to say it, but in the Apocalypse
(xii. 13) Ι read ‘the dragon persecuted the woman which brought forth the
man child, and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into her place.' May not this have been sulfilled in the Holy Virgin,
so that she never tasted of death? Again let 115 give heed to the lessons of
Nature. Science tells us that the lioness can only bring forth once, and Christ
is the lion of the tribe of ι11111611. J ames, the eldest son of Joseph, died in his
ninety-sixth year, having preserved his virginity intact, having never cut his hair
or used a bath, or tasted flesh, or worn more than one tunic. He alone was al-
lowed to enter the Holy of Holies once a year and to wear the priestly petalum,
because he was a Nazarite and of kin to the priests. After other particulars
borrowed from Hegesippus (except that Epiphanius puts into the mouth of
Symeon, son of Clopas, the words ‘Why do you stone the J ust? Behold he
prayeth for you,' which Hegesippus ascribes to ‘a priest of the sons of Rechab')
he continues ‘if then the sons of J oseph were virgins and Nazarites, how much
more would their father have known how to respect the purity of the VirginZ'
Can we conceive it possible that, after all the miracles which attended the birth
of J esus, this pious old inan should have been guilty of impiety towards the
sacred body ἐν ᾧ κατῳκίσθη Θεός 2 But why inquire into these things? Why
not accept what is written and leave the rest to God. Surely you will not
assert that our salvation depends on believing that J oseph did know his wife
after the birth of her first-born. Had the Scripture asserted this we should
have accepted it without scruple. We fully believe in the sanctity of marriage.
But a prophet has no time sor the cares and duties of marriage. Moses had no
children after he entered on his prophetie office, and Mary was a prophet as is
shown by Isa. viii. 3. Hence the daughters of Philip who prophesied were
virgins, and Thecla broke off her engagement when converted by Paul.l

“ But, it is said, how are we to explain such expressions as πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν
αὐτοὺς, and οὐκ ἕγνω αὐτὴν ἕως ὅτου ἐγέννησε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν πρωτότοκον. AS
to the latter it must be observed that it is not said τὸν πρωτότοκον αὐτῆς, not
‘ 1161 first-born,' but ‘her son, the first-born‚’ viz„ the first-born of all creation.
As to the former, what difficulty is there in the phrase οὐκ ᾔδει aim-{1112 [notice
the tacit substitution of ιἤδει for ἔγνω] How was Joseph to know the dignity
conferred on her, until he had seen the miraculous birth? Then as to the
phrase πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν, this might represent an expectation on the part of
Joseph, but this, as we have seen, was precluded by his great age?²

But while we do due honour to the Virgin, we must beware *of deifying her,
as some have done, οὔτε γὰρ θεὸς ἡ Μαρία, οὔτε ἄπ’ οὐρανοῦ τὸ σῶμα, ἀλλ’ ἐκ
συλλήψεως ἀνδρὸς καὶ γυναικός, κατ’ ἐπαγγελίαν δέ, ὥσπερ ὁ Ἰσαάκ. Epiphanius
then proceeds to deal with his seventy-ninth heresy ‘Against the Collyridians
who offer sacrifice to Mary'; where he refers to the history and traditions of
Mary, as stating that it was revealed to J oachim in the desert that his wife
Anna should bear a 61111ὀ.2

 

1 Thecla also appears as a patroness of virginity in Methodius (Banqucc of the Ten
1 mythis), written towards the close of the third century.
