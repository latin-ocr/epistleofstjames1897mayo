clxvi INTRODUOTION

name of the Lord and offer sacrifice to idols (Sim. ix. 21); baptism
being essential to salvation (Vis. iii. 3. 5), even the saints of the old
dispensation had to be baptized before they could enter the
kingdom of God, and this baptism they received from the hands of
the Apostles when they visited the other world after death (Sim.
ix. 16) 3 it is rightly said that there is no other repentance except
that remission of sins which we obtain in baptism (Mami. iv, 3);
by special indulgence one inore opportunity only is granted to the
Church (Vis. ii. 2), but to the Gentiles repentance is possible till
the last day 3 1 special favour and honour are bestowed on him who
does more than is commanded in works of supererogation (Sim. V.
2, 3: M‘cmd. iv. 4); martyrs and confessors should not glory in
their sufferings, but rather thank God, who has allowed them to
expiate their sins by their sufferings (δοξάζειν ὀφείλετε τὸν θεόν,
ὅτι ἀξίους ὑμᾶς ἡγήσατο ὁ θεὸς ἵνα πᾶσαι ὑμῶν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἰαθῶ-
σιν . . . αἱ (γὰρ ἁμαρτίαι ὑμῶν κατεβάρησαν, καὶ εἰ μὴ πεπόνθατε
ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματος κυρίου, διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν τεθνήκειτε ἂν
τῷ θεῷ (Sion. ix, 28. 5, 6). [This seems to have been the opinion
of the Gnostic Basilides, see Glem. Alex„ Str„ iv. p. 600: προαμάρ-
τήσασάν φησι τὴν ψυχὴν ἐν ἑτέρῳ βίῳ τὴν κόλασιν ὑπομένειν
ἐνταῦθα, τὴν μὲν ἐκλεκτὴν ἐπιτίμως διὰ μαρτυρίου, τὴν ἄλλην δὲ
καθαιρομένην οἰκεία κολάσει] The name of Christ is not
mentioned, but we read that the ‘ Son of God‚' who is the corner-
stone and foundation of the Church, the door through which all
men and angels must enter to be saved, who existed before all
worlds as the Holy Spirit, became incarnate in human flesh‚ τὸ
πνεῦμα τὸ ἅνγιον, τὸ προόν, τὸ κτίσαν πᾶσαν τὴν κτίσιν κατῴκισεν
ὁ θεὸς εἰς σάρκα ἣν ἠβούλετο (Sim. V. 5, 6, ix. 1, 12, 14). Harnack
thinks that the Son of God is identified with Michael, the first of
the angels, see his notes on Vis. iii. 4. 1, v. 2, Sim. viii. 3. 3, ix, 6.
Believers who have persevered to the end become angels after
death (Sim. ix. 24, 25, cf. Clem. Al„ Ecl. Pr„ p. 1004, οἱ «γὰρ ἐξ
ἀνθρώπων εἰς ἀγγέλους μεταστάντες χίλια ἔτη μαθητεύονται ὑπὸ
τῶν ἀγγέλων εἰς τελειότητα ἀποκαθιστάμειόι, εἶτα οἱ μὲν διδάξαν-
τες μετατίθενται εἰς ἀρχανγνγελικὴν ἐξουσίαν). Mention is made of
false prophets who give responses for money and lead astray the
double-minded (Mami. xi), and also of false teachers (Gnostics)
who profess to know everything and really know nothing (Sim. ix.

q} This-stgrgct Montanistic view is not consistently adhered to (cf. Μανιιῑ. xii. 6 ;
AZ'JPI. vul. .
