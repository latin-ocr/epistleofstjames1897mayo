131, v, 7 τειμιον). The codex has at length been made accessible to
all by the beautiful photographic reproduction brought out under
the direction of Signor Cozza-Luzi‚ the Librarian of the Vatican.

SIN. (or ἃ). CODEX ΞΙΝΑῘΤΙΟΠΞ, discovered by Tischendorf in
the convent at Mount Sinai on Feb. 4, 1859, and published by
him in 1862. It is now in the library at St. Petersburg. It is
written continuously without stops or breathings. Contained
originally the whole of the Old Testament, including the Apocrypha
(of this a large portion is now wanting) 3 the New Testament (still
entire); the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas
(of this last a large part is lost). Errors from itacisrn, such as the
confusion of αι and ε, ει and ι, are frequent. WVestcott and Hort
consider it the most valuable MS. after B, giving in the main a
Pre-Syrian text but to a certain extent corrupted by Western and
Alexandrian readings. Tischendorf, as was natural, codicem suum τε
vera praestantissimam fortasse plus (aequo miratus est (C. R. Gregory
Prol. to Tischendorf's N.T. p. 353), and has in some instances been
thus induced to prefer what seems to me an inferior reading. See
especially iii. 5, 6, where his text is ἰδοῦ ἡλίκου πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην
ἀνάπτει ἡ Ύλῶσσα. πῦρ, ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας, ἡ Γγλῶσσα καθίσ-
ταται ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ σπιλοῦσα ὅλου τὸ σῶμα καὶ φλο-
Ι’γίζουσα κ.τ.λ., iv. 2 μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε. καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε διὰ τὸ
μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς· αἰτεῖτε κτλ.

A. CODEX ALEXANDRINUS in the British Museum. Oontains
the old and New Testaments‚ together with two epistles of
Clement. It is written continuously with occasional stops and,
very rarely, a breathing or accent. A photographic facsimile of
the N.T. was brought out by the authorities of the British
Museum in 1879.

C. CODEX EPHRAEMI. No. 9 in the Library at Paris. This is a
palimpsest containing fragments of the Old and New Testaments‚
over which were written in the 12th century some treatises of
Ephraen] the Syrian. About three-fifths of the N.T. are pre-
served. The writing is continuons, with occasional stops, and
spaces left at the end of a paragraph. It was printed by Tischen-
dorf in 1843. The end of St. J ames (iv. 3 to v, 20) is wanting.
