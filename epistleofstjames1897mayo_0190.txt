and Jas. i. 26—ii. 2. Thus μάταιος of Jas. i. 26 recurs in Pet. i. 183
πατρί, ἄσπιλον, κόσμου of Jas. i. 27 recur in Pet. i. 17, 19, 203
προσωπολημψίαις, πίστιν, δόξης of Jas. ii. 1 are found in Pet. i. 17,
213 χρυσοδακτύλιος Of Jas. ii. 2 and ὁ χρυσὸς καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος
κατίωται of Jas. v. 3 are represented in Pet. i. 18 by the words
φθαρτοῖς, ἀργυρίῳ ἢ χρυσίῳ. What do we find then in Pet. to
correspond to μὴ ἐν προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν τοῦ κυρίου
ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς δόξηςῑ The words of Pet. i. 17 are εἰ
πατέρα ἐπικαλεῖσθε τὸν ἀπροσωλήμπτως κρίνοντα, and we may
gather his interpretation of πίστιν and δόξης from ver. 21 τοὺς δι’
αὐτοῦ πιστοὺς εἰς θεὸν τὸν ἐγείραντα αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν καὶ δόξαν
αὐτῷ δόντα, ὥστε τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν . . . εἶναι εἰς θεόν. Here it is
the Father² not Christ, who judges without respect of persons3
saith is in God, not in Christ3 the glory is resident in God and
bestowed by Him on Christ. Would St. Peter have written thus,
if he had had the present text of our Epistle before his eyes?

The same method of treatment is applied in i. 1 Ἰάκωβος θεοῦ
καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοῦλος, but While Massebieau would
bracket only the name Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Spitta omits the four words
between θεοῦ and δοῦλος, giving the phrase θεοῦ δοῦλος which we
find in Tit. i. 1. Massebieau's excision would give θεοῦ καὶ κυρίου
δοῦλος, which he thinks is supported by the other compound
phrases (ὁ θεὸς καὶ πατήρ, i. 273 ὁ κύριος καὶ πατήρ, iii. 9) used
of God in the Epistle. I do not however remember any example
of the phrase θεὸς καὶ κύριος. Philo has κύριος καὶ θεός in this
order (M., p. 581), and κύριος ὁ θεός occurs frequently, even where
the Hebrew has the inverted order, as Ps. lxxxv. 8, ‘ I will hearken
what God the Lord will say.' Of the two suggestions I prefer
Spitta’s, but it has nothing special to recommend it, as we found
to be the case in the previous verse. If the Epistle is proved on
other grounds to be pre-Christian, we should then be compelled to
admit interpolation here, but not otherwise. We cannot, of course,
deny that interpolation is a vcra eausa. We have examples of
Hebrew books which have undergone Christian revision in the
Fourth Book of Ezra, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs‚
the Didache‚ the Sibylline Books, &a A natural objection how-
ever to the alleged interpolation in this case is that, if it were
desired to give a Christian colour to a Hebrew treaffise, the inter—
polator would not have confined himself to inserting the name of
Christ in two passages only3 he would at any rate have introduced
