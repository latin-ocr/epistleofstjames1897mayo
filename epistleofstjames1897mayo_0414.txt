of selfishness 3 he would make religion a help to serving the world, cf.
1 Tim. vi. 4, 5.

ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν ὃαπανήσ-ητε.1] Cf. Luke XV„ where δαπανήσαν-
τος αὐτοῦ πάντα (V. 14) is explained by ὁ καταφαγών σου τὸν βίον μετὰ
πορνῶν (v. 30). The object here is understood from αἰτεῖτε. In Acts
saxi. 24 δαπ. 15 followed by ἐπί, in classic-al writers usually by εἰς, but
also by πρός, ἀμφί, or the simple dat. 3 there is however no occasion to
separate ἐν from the verb (as Alf), cf. Thuc. vii. 48. 5 ἐν περιπολίοις
ἀναλίσκοντας, where Poppo cites Arist. Eth. iV. 2. 20 ἐν τοῖς μικροῖς τῶν
δαπανημάτων πολλὰ ἀναλίσκει, Aristid. (cdv. Lept. p. 62 τὴν ἐν τοῖς τοιού-
τοις δαπάνην, and compares Lat. consumere ιή re. The extreme of this
{³a7rosu770e9 is seen in the ἐτρυφήσατε and ἐσπαταλήσατε Of V. 5. Prayel'
for this is the opposite to prayer for daily bread, and to Matt. vi. 32,
33 ‘ seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added
unto you, for your Father knoweth γε have need of these things.'
Compare the conclusion of Juvenal’s tenth Satire.

4. μοιχαλίδες.] Recent editors follow A. B. Sin. in omitting μοιχοὶ
καί, and understand the word in the figurative sense of adulterous souls,
in accordance with the language of the 0111, which speaks of Israel as
married to Jeho‘v'ah (Isa. lvii. 3—9, Jer. iii. 20, Ezek. 16 esp. VV. 32, 35,
38, ib. ch. 23,Hosea ch. 2), and of the NT. which speaks of the Ohurch
as the Lanib's Wife (2 Cor. xi. 1 2, Eph. v. 22—32, Apoc. xix. 7, ib.
xxi. 9). It is less usual to find this figure used to express the
relation of the individual soul to God, but cf. Psa. lxxiii. 27, Rom.
vii. 2-4, Clem. 110111. 111. 28 ὁπόταν ἡ ψυχὴ ὑφ’ ἑτέρων σπαρῇ, τότε, ὡς
πορνεύσασα ἢ μοιχευσαμένη, ὑπὸ τοῦ Πνεῦματος ἐγκαταλείπεται. The
insertion of μοιχοί was natural when μοιχαλίς was understood literally,
but the context and especially ver. 5 are in favour of the figurative
meaning. [Spitta however takes it of litera] adultery, though he
thinks the feminine is used tropically of both sexes when seduced by
evil spirits] The word, which is unclassical (Lol). Pleo‘gsn. p. 452), is
found in LXX. Mal. iii. 5 (where μοιχούς 15 read by some), Rom. vii. 3,
2 Pet. 11. 14 ὀφθαλμοὶ μεστοὶ μοιχαλίδος, (Plut.) Plac. Phil. 1. 7, p. 881 D
ὑπὸ μοιχοῦ καὶ μοιχαλίδος ἐδολοφονεύθη, and in figurative use Matt. xii.
39, XVi. 4 γενεὰ πονηρὰ καὶ μοιχαλίς.

οἴδατε] See n. on i. 19. The reference is to our Lord's words Matt.
vi. 24.

ἡ ῲιλία. τοῦ ndu-pou] The word φιλία is defined by Aristotle (Eth. N.
Xiii. 2) εὔνοιαν μὴ λανθάνουσαν ἐν ἀντιπεπονθόσι φιλίαν εἶναι, involving
the idea of leving, as well as of being loved, cf. John xv. 19 ὁ κόσμος ἂν
τὸ ἴδιον ἐφίλει, 2 Tim. iv. 10 Δημᾶς...ἀγαπη’σας τὸν νῦν αἰῶνα. It is not
found elsewhere in N .T. but occurs in LXX. (Prov. xxvii. 5). See
above 1. 27, 2 Pet. 1. 4 ἵνα γένησθε θείας κοινωνοὶ φύσεως ἀποφυγόντες τῆς
ἐν κόσμῳ ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ φθορᾶς, Tit. ii. 12 ἵνα ἀρνησάμενοι τὰς κοσμικὰς ἐπιθυ-
μίας εὐσεβῶς ζήσωμεν.

ἔχθρα. τοῦ Θεοῦ e'onrwj] Rom. viii. 7 τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς ἔχθρα εἷς
Θεόν...οἶ δὲ ἐν σαρκὶ ὄντες Θεῷ ἀρέσαι οὗ δύνανται, 1 John ii. 15, Luke Vi.
