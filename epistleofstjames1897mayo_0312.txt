32 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Iseo. 426 ΠΟΑ. χαῖρ’ ὦ τεκοῦσα, χαῖρε Κασσάνδρα τέ μοι. εΕΚ. χαίρουσιν
ἄλλοι, μητρὶ δ’ οὐκ ἔστιν τόδε, Tobit. V. 9 (varia lectio) ἐχαιρέτισεν αὐτὸν
πρῶτος καὶ εἶπεν αῧτῳ, χαίρειν σοὶ καὶ πολλὰ γένοιτο · καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς Τ. εἶπεν
αὐτῷ, τί μοι ἔτι ὑπάρχει χαίρειν ; Plato Ep. 8 beginning. For the thought
ef. Matt. v. 10-15, 1 Pet. iV. 12-14 μὴ ξενίζεσθε (at your trials) ὡς
ξένου ὑμῖν συμβαίνοντος, it is not strange or foreign to your Christian
life, but a part of your training for glory, therefore χαίρετε, so 1 Thess.
iii. 3 οἴδατε ὅτι εἷς τοῦτο κείμεθα, Acts v. 4, Judith viii. 25.

ἡγήσασθε.] We might have expected the present tense, like ἡγεῖσθε
in 2 Pet. iii. 15 and below λαλεῖτε 11. 12, as the aorist is used rather of
a single aot than of a continuous state; but it is here employed in
reference to each separate temptation as it occurs, perhaps also as more
urgent, like μακροθυμήσατε in V. 7. [The aorist is used as the authori-
tative imperative in 2 Tim. i. 8, 14, ii. 3, 15, &a A.] ; ef. Winer tr. p.
393 foll.

ἀδελφοί μου.] In the O.T. the word is used of Israelites generally
(LeV. xxv. 46, Deut. XV. 3), denoting‚ as Philo says (Caria. M.2 p.
388), οὗ μόνον τὸν ἐκ τῶν αὐτῶν φύντα γονέων ἀλλὰ καὶ ὃς ἂν ἀστὸς ἢ
ὁμόφυλος ᾗς so also in ΝΤ. (Acts ii. 29, Rom. ix. 3), but here it is
more commonly used of the spiritual Israel (Matt. xxiii. 8, xxv. 40,
Acts ix. 30, 1 Cor. V. 11), equivalent to the later ‘Christians ' (see
below v. 9 and ii. 15). St. James frequently makes use of this appeal-
ing address (ii. 1, 14, iii. 1, 10, 12, v. 12, 19), sometimes without μου
(iv. 11, v. 7, 9, 10), sometimes with the addition of ἀγαπητοί (1. 16, 19,
ii. 5). The simple ἀδελφοί is the most frequent in St. Paul’s epistles.
In the two epistles of St. Peter and the other catholic epistles ἀγαπητοί
is often used by itself.

πειρασμοῖς.] Here used of outward trial, as in the parallel passage in
1 Pet. i. 6 ἐν ᾧ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε, ὀλίγον ἄρτι εἷ δέον λυπηθέντες ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασ-
μοῖς, ἵνα τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως...εὗρεθῇ εἷς ἔπαινον κ.τ.λ. We
have examples of such trials in the perseeutions which followed the
martyrdom of Stephen and of James‚ and in St. Paul’s description of
his own sufferings (1 Cor. iv. 9 foll„ 2 Cor. xi. 23 foll). There may
also be an allusion to the massaere of the Jews· of the eastern Diaspora
some ten years before the writing of the Epistle. The inner trial
(temptation) is expressed below (v. 13) by the verb πειράζω. Dr.
Hatoh (Essays in Biblical Greek, p. 71 foll.) seems to me to restrict the
sense too much to one kind of trial, viz. affiiction. Riohes, as we see
from'ver. 10 and 1 Tim. vi. 9, are as much a πειρασμός as poverty, and
the temptation of Christ in the wilderness (Luke iv. 13) was not an
appeal to fear but rather to hope and desire. See Comment on
- Temptation.

περιπέσητε.] The word brings out the externality of the temptation
in opposition to the internal temptation arising from ἰδία ἐπιθυμία (v. 14).
Cf. Luke X. 30 λῃσταῖς περίεπεσεν, 2 llffaCC. X. περιπεσεῖν κακοῖς, Plato
Leyy. ix. 877 C. π. συμφοραῖς, Μ. Ant. ii. 11 τοῖς μὲν κατ’ ἀλήθειαν
κακοῖς ἵνα μὴ περιπίπτῃ ὁ ἅνθρωπος, ἐπ’ αὐτῷ τὸ πᾶν ἔθεντο, Acta Joltcmnis
Zahn p. 244 n. ἐὰν περιπέσῃς πειρασμοῖς μὴ πτοηθήσῃ. Heisen gives
many examples.
