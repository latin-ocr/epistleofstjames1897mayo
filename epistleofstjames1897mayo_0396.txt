116 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

άρκτους παρδάλεις κ. τ. λ. Field cites Eur. Avol. (ap.Pl11t.1[01· p. 9 54)Ι
ἡ βραχύ τοι σθέι ος ἀνέρος· ἀλλὰ ποικιλίᾳ πραπιδων δαμᾷ φῦλα πόντου χθονίων
τ’ ἀερίων τε παιδεύματα. It w -ι5 a common· place of the Stoics, 566 (¹10.

V.]).11. 151, 1581011, Senec. Benef. ii. 29 eoyita quanta nobis tribum&
Parens noster, quanto iJalentiora animalia sul) impsum miserimus, quanto
velociora consequamur, quam nihil sit mortale non sub ictu nostro
positum. Erasmus in his Paraphrase illustrates as follows: eiecto-antur
leones, mcinsuescunt tiyricles, serviunt etiam elephanti, subiguntur el
crocodili, mitescunt aspides, redduntur familiares aquilae et vultures, ad
amicitiam alliciuntur delphini. The writer here follows Gen. i= 28, ix.
2, Ps. viii. 6-8.

8. οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων] But if so, how can the Psalmist
say παῦσον τὴν γλῶσσάν σου ἀπὸ κακοῦ (xxxiV. 13), and vow not to sin with
the tongue (xvii. 3, xxxix, l)'.2 So Prov. xiii. 3. This may be partly
explained by the emphatic position of ἀνθρώπων. Man cannot do it by
himself, but he who is τέλειος may do it (ver. 2), and such perfection is
attainable through the help of God given in answer to prayerg see
above i. 5 and compare the Psalmist’s prayer, cxli. 3. So Aug. <le nect„
et grat. 0. 15 non enim ait, linquam nullus domare potest, sed nullus
leontinum j ut cum domatur, Dei misericordia, Dei adjutorio, Dei (frasta
fierifateamur. The Pelagians, followed here by Oecumenius, read this
verse as a question (Schegg). In the next place ἡ γλῶσσα, when
regarded as setting on fire the whole round of life, 15 not simply the·
speech of the individual, but that multiplied and re-echoed athousand-
sold by the voices of others and by the power of the press 3 parva vmetii
primo moa· sese attollit in auras. However a man may learn to control
his own tongue, these echoes are beyond all human power.

ἀκατάστατον κακόν.] Cf. above 1. 8, also Herm. Mand. ii. 3 πονηρὰ ἡ κατα-
λαλιά, ἀκατάστατον δαιμόνιόν ἐστιν, μηδέποτε εἷρηνεῦον, where Ham. cites¹
Orig. in Joann. (Opp. iv. p. 355) οὐκ ὤκνησαν καὶ τὰ νομισθέντα ἂν ἐλάχιστα
εἶναι τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων δαιμονίοις προσάψαι οἱ φήσαντες τὴν ὀξυχολίαν δαι-
μόνιον εἶναι, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὴν καταλαλιάν, and below ver. 16 ἀκαταστασία.
Erdmann and Hofmann read ἀκατάσχετον with Cod. Ephr., the Peshitto,
and some other versions, and we find the word similarly used by Philo
M. 1. p. 695 τὸ στόμα ὃιανοίξαντες καὶ ἐάσαντες ἀχαλίνωτον, καθάπερ ῥεῦμα
ἀκατάσχετον, φέρεσθαι τὸν ἀκριτόμυθον λόγον ε’ὣσι. This would sult the
passage very well, agreeing with Ps. xii. 43 but the other reading is
generally accepted and gives a good sense ‘ restless,' ‘unquiet‚' like the
least tameable beasts3 others translate as in i. 8 ‘unstable,' ‘ incon·
sistent‚’ which they think agrees better with V. 9 foll„ but it is a
somewhat incongruous epithet for κακόν. See above i. 8. We should
naturally take the words ἀκ. κ. as acc. in apposition to τὴν γλῶσσαν..
like i. 8 ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, but the following nom. makes it more probable
that there is a sudden change of construction, ἀκ. κ. being the predicate
of an independent sentence with ἡ γλῶσσα understood as subject3 cf.
hlark Xii. 38 foll. βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν...οἶ
ΚατεσθίΟνΤΕς Τὰς ΟἶΚίας Τῶν Χηρῶν· ΟῙΙΤΟΙ. λημψονται περίσσόΤΕρΟν Κρίμα
In the Apocalypse we meet with many of these irregular appositions‚
e. g. i. 5 ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῑ, ὃ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός. ib. XX. 2 ἐκράτησεν τὸν
