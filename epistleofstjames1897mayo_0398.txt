An example of such cursing is in John vii 49‘ ο ὄχλος οὗτος -ἐπάρατοῖ

‘whosoever sheddeth blood, they reckon 113 to him as if he (liminished

01311018 of the Fathers between εἰκών, the common image belonging to
13110 whole human race in virbue of their being all part-akers in reason
and conscience, and ὁμοίωσις bhe potentiality of moral 3881111113131011 to

Epicurus deos hominum similes dicere quam homines deorum. Though
13110 Divine image is traceable in every child of man (as Bengel says,
remanet nobilitas indelebilis), yet} ib 18 only perfect in 13110 Second Adam
(Heb. i. 3, Col. i. 15, 2 Cor. iV. 4), into whose image the believer 18
being gradually transformed (001. iii. 10, Eph. iv, 24, 2 Cor. iii. 18).
For the argument, here cf. Gen. ix. 6, Prov. xiv. 31, Mati. XXV. 35

Whass was the general feeling of 13110 Jews about cursingZ The old law
required the Israelite 130 curse on Mont Ebal and bless on Mounb
Gerizim. The fact: too that cursing was forbidden in special cases,
as against parents (Exod. xxi. 17), ‘che king (ib.=xxii. 28),13110 deaf (Lev.
xix. 14), seems to show that, 113 was 11013 generally condemned under the
old dispensation. 111 18 referred 130 withoub implying blame, Prov. xi.
26, xxiv. 24, xxvi. 2, xxx. 10, Eccles. vii. 21, X. 90. Compare also the
curse of canaan by Noah (Gen, ix, 25), that of Simeon and Levi by
their father (Gen. xliX. 7 ), of the builder of J ericho by J oshua (J osh.
vi. 26),Abimelech by J otham (J ud. ix. 20, 57), Meroz by Deborah (ib.
v. 23), 13110 children by Elisha (2 K. ii. 24), apostate Jews by Nehemiah
