clxviii INTRODUOTION

theory. It is unnecessary here to examine it in detail, but I may
remark that it is vitiated by the same α priori method to which I
called attention before. A letter is not necessarily bound together
by strict logic, like a philosophica] treatise. More commonly it is
a loose jotting down of facts, thoughts, or feelings, which the writer
thinks likely to be either interesting or useful to his correspondent.
If slowly written, as this undoubtedly was, it naturally reflects the
varying moods of the writer’s mind. Even the Hebrew prophets

are not always denunciatory 3 even St. Paul is not always argu-
mentative.

I am far however from admitting the alleged want of connexion
in our Epistle 3 nor do Ι think it will be admitted by any careful
reader, or by any one who will take the trouble to read my fifth
chapter (on the Contents of the Epistle) or the analysis given in
Massebieau‚ pp. 2-5. As to the objection founded on the use of
the same word in different senses, this might easily arise from a
limited vocabulary or a defect in subtilty of discrimination. In
the particular instance cited, objective temptation is naturally and
properly expressed by the noun, subjective temptation by the verb.
But the same mental characteristic is seen in the double uses of
πίστις and σοφία, and in my edition (p. 202) Ι illustrated this by
the double use of ἔρις in Hesiod, and of ’πανουργία in Sirac. xxi. 12.
The peculiarity is imitated by Hermas in his use of the word τρυφή
(Sim. vi. 5).

Having thus pointed out what appear to me the overwhelming
objections to the T'i'ibingen theory, that the Epistle was written in
the middle of the second century aster Christ, I have now to
examine the opposite theory which makes it a product of the first
century before Christ. As I joined Jiilicher with Harnack in
considering the former theory, so Ι propose to supplement
Spitta's Zur Gesclm'clcto (les Urclw'istcntlmms by Massebieau's very
interesting paper, L'Epsztre (Ic Jaoqucs, cst-elle Z'OEzcvre ol’wm Chremen?
pp. 1-35, reprinted from the Romae dc Z’Histoz're des Religion-3 for
1895, in which he arrives independently at the same conclusion
as Spitta.

The arguments adduced in favour of the pre—Christian author-
ship of the Epistle seem to me to be of far greater weight than
those which we have previously considered, and I am willing to
admit that a strong case is made out for the supposition of inter—
