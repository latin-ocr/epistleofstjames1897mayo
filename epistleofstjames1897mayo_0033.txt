THE AUTHOR xiii
of the unmarried to the married state by referring to the example
of the Lord’s mother, ‘of whom we read in Scripture that she
bore children to her husband Joseph? Jerome does not attempt
to answer this by appealing to tradition: on the contrary he alto-
gether repudiates tradition, professing to derive his theory from a
critical examination of Scripture. His argument briefly stated is,
that James the brother of the Lord is called an Apostle by St.
Paul, that he must therefore be identified with 5 ames the son of
Alphaeus, since James the son of Zebedee was no longer living
when Paul wrote ; identified also with 5611163 the less in Mark XV,
40 (the comparative implying an opposition to 5611163 the greater,l
viz. the son of Zebedee), this 5611163 being there stated to be
brother of Joses. But in Mark vi. 3 we find a James and 50363
among the brethren of 563113, and this agrees with John xix. 25,
where Mary the mother of James and wife of Alphaeus is called
Mary of Clopas, sister of the Lord’s mother; from whence it
follows that the four brothers and two or more sisters mentioned
in Mark vi. 3 and elsewhere 616 really first cousins of Jesus.
56101116 himself had no information on the subject of Clopas‚ but
suggests that 116 may possibly have been father of Mary. Later
writers added further developments to this theory. Clopasjrwas
identified with Alphaeus, as another form of the common Ara-
maic original Chalphai ; and ‘Judas of James,' who occurs in
St. Luke's list of the Apostles (Luke vi. 16, Acts i. 13), is identified
with the writer of the Epistle‚ who calls himself ‘brother of
James’ (Jude 1), and also with the brother of Joses, 5611163
and Simon in Mark vi. 3. Simon Zelotes‚ who 13 joined with
James and Judas in the list of the Apostles, is supposed to be
another of these brethren: and some held that Matthew‚ being
identical with Levi the son of Alphaeus, must belong to the same
family.

Bishop Lightfoot calls attention to the fact that not only does
56101116 make no pretence to any traditional support for this view?

James the Great’ (Lightf00t‚ G'al. p. 263).

‘2 After disputing the value of the authorities appealed to by Helvidius, he sets
aside the appeal to authority in the words Veram ozzlqas terimus cl sonte veritatis
omisso opinionum rivulos consectamur (Adv. Helv. 17) ; and in another treatise (Dc
Viris Illuslribus 2) contrasts his own view with the Epiphanian in the words Ut

nonnulli existimant, Joseplz ex alia icn.²ore,· ut antem mihi ridetur, Mariae sororis
macris Domini... filius (Lightfoot, p. 259).
