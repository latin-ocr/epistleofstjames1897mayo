98 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Acts xix. 15 ‘Jesus I know and Paul I knOW.' They suggest evil*
thoughts to men: hence σοφία δαιμονιώδης below iii. 15, διδασκαλίαις
δαιμονίων 1 Tim. iv. 1. The same term is applied to heathen deities
1 Cor. X. 20 foll.

καὶ φρίσσουσιν] The word, which properly means ‘ to bristle,' is used
like the Lat. lem-reo of the physical signs of terror, especially of the
hair standing on end, as in Job. iv. 14, 15. But the RV. translation
‘shudder,’ seems too bold a metaphorto apply in English to spirits. It comes
to express only a high degree of awe or terror, as Daniel, after the vision
of the four beasts and their disappearance before the coming of the Son
of Man, says ἔφριξε τὸ πνεῦμά μου (vii. 15), Prayer of Manasses 4 Κύριε
...ὃν πάντα φρίσσει καὶ τρέμει ἀπὸ προσώπου δυνάμεώς σου, hence τὸ φρικ-
τὸν ὄνομα, φρικτὰ μυστήρια 01‘ ὄργια, μαρμαίρων τι φρικῶδες Of the dazzling
splendour of the robes of Herod (Euseb. HE. ii. 10); it is even used
of the effect on the mind of a favourable omen Xen. Cyr. iv. 2, 15 ὥστε
πᾶσι μὲν φρίκην ἐγγίγνεσθαι πρὸς τὸ θεῖον, θάρρος δὲ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους.
The occasion of this terror is mentioned in Matt. viii. 29 quoted above,
cf. Heb. x. 27 (for those who sin after receiving knowledge of the truth
there remains) φοβερά τις ἐκδοχὴ κρίσεως, Philo M. 1 p. 218 ἐπὶ τοῖς
προσδοκωμένοις φοβεροῖς τρέμοντές τε καὶ φρίττοντες. We find many
reminiscences of this saying of St. J ames, eg. J ustin Trypho 49 (Χρισ-
τὸν) καὶ τὰ δαιμόνια φρίσσει καὶ πᾶσαι ἁπλῶς αῖ ἀρχαὶ καὶ ἐξουσίαι τῆς γῆς,
Acta Philippi T. p. 86 Θεὲ ὃν φρίττουσιν πάντες αἰῶνες. . .ὃν τρέμουσιν ἀρχαὶ
τῶν ἐπουρανίων, Lactant. de Ira c. 23 Apollo IlIiZesius de Judaeorum
religsione consultus responso hoc {mliclit...3v τρέμεται καὶ γαῖα καὶ οὐρανὸς
ἠδὲ θάλασσα, ταρτάρεοί τε μυχοὶ καὶ δαίμονες ἐκφρίττουσιν, Orphica ap.
Clem. Al. Strom. V. p. 724 P. δαίμονες ὃν φρίσσουσι (Herm. Orph. p. 454),
Ignat. Philip. p. 175 (ὁ σταυρὸς) ἐστὶ τὸ τροπαῖον κατὰ τῆς αὐτοῦ (τοῦ
διαβόλου) δυνάμεως, ὅπερ ὁρῶν φρίττει.

20. θέλεις δὲ γνῶναι·] Cf. Rom. Xiii. 3 θέλεις δὲμὴ φοβεῖσθαι; τὸ ἄγα-
θὸν ποίει. The question is equivalent to a condition ‘ if you wish for a
conclusive proof that saith by itself cannot save, take the case of
Abraham.' It would seem that from this point St. J ames speaks again
in his own name.

ὦ ἄνθρωπε κενέ.] Cf. Rom. ii. 1 ὦ ἄνθρωπε πᾶς ὃ κρίνων, ix. 20 ὦ
ἄνθρωπε, μενοῦνγε σὺ τίς εῗ,· 1 Tim. vi. 11 ὦ ἄνθρωπε Θεοῦ. Κενός < = Raca)
is defined (Epict. Diss. iv. 4. 25) as one ἐφ’ οἷς οὐ δεῖ ἐπαιρόμενος; like
vanus it is used of a man who cannot be depended on, whose deeds do
not correspond to his words, hence of boasters (Soph. Am. 703 οὗτοι δια-
πτυχθέντες ὤφθησαν κενοι) and impostors, joined with ἀλαζων Plut. Via.
p. 581 F. Perhaps the words in Hermas Mami, xi. 3 αὐτὸς κενὸς ὢν
κενῶς ἀποκρίνεται κενοῖς· ὃ ’γὰρ ἂν ἐπερωτηθῇ πρὸς τὸ κένωμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
ἀποκρίνεται, and ib. 13 (τὸ ἐπίγειον πνεῦμα) κολλᾶται τοῖς διψύχοις καὶ
κενοῖς, 15 οἱ προφῆται οἱ κενοί, may refer to our text: cf. Diclaclaeb 2. 5
οὐκ ἔσται ὁ λόγος σου ψευδής, οὗ κενός, ἀλλὰ μεμεστωμένος πράξει. Hilgen-
field and others who suppose this argument on faith and works to be
directed against 813. Paul imagine that 813. Paul himself is here ad-
dressed. See Introduction.
