ccxvi ΙΝ TRODUOTION

συμφέρει αὐτῷ ἵνα κρεμασθῇ λίθος, John iv. 34 ἐμὸν βρῶμά ἐστιν
ἵνα ποιῶ τὸ θέλημα, Luke i. 43 πόθεν μοι τοῦτο ἵνα ἔλθῃ ἡ μήτηρ,
1 Cor. iv. 3 ἐμοὶ εἰς ἐλάχιστόν ἐστιν ἵνα ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀνακριθῶ, or
instead of the inf. with art. explaining the purport of what pre-
cedes, as in Phil. i. 9 τοῦτο προσεύχομαι, ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη περισσεύσῃ,
1 John iv. 17 ἐν τούτῳ τετελείωται ἡ ἀγάπη, ἵνα παρρησίαν
ἔχωμεν, or where we should have expected the inf. with ὥστε,
eg. Gal. v. 17 ταῦτα ἀλλήλοις ἀντίκειται, ἵνα μὴ ἃ ἐὰν θέλητε
ποιῆτε, 1 Th. v. 4 οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει, ἵνα ἦ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς
κλέπτας καταλάβῃ.

On the whole I should be inclined to rate the Greek of this
Epistle as approaching more nearly to the standard of Classical
purity than that of any other book of the N .T. with the exception
perhaps of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The author of the latter
lias no doubt greater copiousness, and inore variety of construction&
he is also occasionally very idiomatic, as in the phrase ἔμαθεν ἀφ’
ὧν ἔπαθεν v. 83 but while the distinction between μή and οὐ is
caresully preserved in our Epistle, we find in the Hebrews μή used
incorrectly after ἐπεί, ix, 17 ἐπεὶ μὴ τότε (αἰ. μήποτε) ἰσχύει, ὅτε
ζῇ ὁ διαθέμενος, and with the participle, xi. 8 ἐξῆλθεν μὴ ἐπιστά-
μενος, ver. 13 κατὰ πίστιν ἀπέθανον μὴ κομίσαντες, ver. 27 πίστει
κατέλιπεν Αἴγυπτον μὴ φοβηθεὶς τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βασιλέως (in con-
trast with J ames i. 25). Again, the latter writer is less accurate in
his use of the inoods and tenses than our author. Thus we find the
aor. with οὔπω in xii. 4, where a Classical writer would have used the
perfect, οὔπω μέχρις αἵματος ἀντικατέστητε...καὶ ἐκλέλησθε τῆς
παρακλήσεως; we find ὅταν with the aor. subj. followed by pres.
ind. in i. 6 ὅταν πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ τὸν πρωτότοκον εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην
λέγει, where ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ seems to be equivalent to εἰσάγωνε we
find irregular uses of the inf. in ii. 3 ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα λαλεῖσθαι,
ii. 15 διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν, iX. 24 εἰς οὐρανὸν εἰσῆλθεν νῦν ἐμφανισθῆ-
ναι τῷ προσώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ, vi. 1Ο οὐ γὰρ ἄδικος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπιλαθέσθαι
τοῦ ἔργου; we find post—classica] uses of the prepositions, eg. παρὰ
after the comparative in i. 4, iii. 3 and elsewhere3 εἰς used with
persons, ii. 3 εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐβεβαιώθη; εἰς τὸ used of the consequence,
xi. 3 πίστει νοοῦμεν κατηρτίσθαι τοὺς αἰῶνας ῥήματι Θεοῦ εἰς τὸ
μὴ ’κ φαινομένων γεγονέναι; α’πό used where a classical writer
would have written διά with acc. v, 7 εἰσακουσθεὶς ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλα-
βείας; not to mention the use of such a Pauline anacoluthon as
xiii. 5 α’φιλάργυρος ὁ τρόπος, ἀρκούμενοι τοῖς παροῦσιν.
