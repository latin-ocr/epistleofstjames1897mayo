which would limit the scope 01 the words by presenting them as an
antithesis to the preceding clause. It is such of course in the first
instance: as the failure to show inercy or consideration for others
forbids 115 to expect mercy ourselves, so by the exercise of mercy man
gathers to himself ⁴ a good reward against the day 01 necessity' (Tobit
iv. 9), since ‘ God is not unrighteous to forget the labour that proceedeth
of 10176 ' (Heb. vi. 10). But the asyndeton allows the words to be taken
in their widest generality, as embodying the very essence 01 the Christian
law 01 liberty, affirming the universal principle 01 God’s judgment,
even when it seems to be ἀνέλεος, and supplying the rule for the
believer's daily life, 01. Philo M. 1. p. 284 commenting on Ps. 101. 1
·’ Ι 117111 sing 01 mercy and judgment) οὐ μόνον δικάσας ἐλεεῖ ἀλλὰ ἐλεήσας
δικάζει· πρεσβύτερος γὰρ δίκης ὁ ἕλεος παρ’ αὐτῷ ἐστίν, ἅτε τὸν κολάσεως
ἄξιον οὐ μετὰ τὴν δίκην ἀλλὰ πρὸ δίκης εἰδότι.

14—26. In this section St. James proceeds to enlarge on the meaning
and nature of that saith in J esus Christ which was spoken 01 in ver. 1
as inconsistent with προσωπολημψία. Η6 (11176115 on the contrast, noted
in i. 26, between mere outward religion and> the consec-ration 01 the
life to (jod. If a man πίστιν ἔχει ἐν προσωπολημψίαις, iS not this the
same as having a profession of saith which is not evidenced by deeds'}
But it is not such saith as this that can ever triumph over judgment.
Compare the words 01 St. John (1 ep. ii. 4> ὁ λέγων ὅτι Ἔγνωκα αὗτὸν,
καὶ τὰς ἐντολὰς μὴ τηρῶν, ψεύστης ἐστίν. Τ116 apocryphal fourth book

agitated among the Jews, see ix. 7, 8 ⁴ whoever shall be able to escape
either by his works or by his saith shall see my salvati0n‚’ also viii.

on Dent. xi. 13) ‘ The sacred textl means to show that practice depends
on doctrine and not doctrine on practice : and so we find God punishes
more severely for doctrine than for practice, as it is said (Hosea iv. 1)

to such views Justin refers (Trgypla. 370 D> οὐχ ὡς ὑμεῖς ἅπατᾶτε ἑαυτοὺς

boots it,’ instead 01 ‘what is the good'), especially when the verb 15

suits the passage. It is omitted also by Philo M. 1. p. 241 τί γὰρ ὄφελος
