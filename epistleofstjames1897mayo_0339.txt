μὲν τροπῆς διὰ τὸ φύσει θνητὸν ἐγγινομένης, τῆς δὲ ἐλευθερίας διὰ τὴν τοῦ
Θεοῦ θεραπείαν ἐπιγινομένης. Schneckenburger takes τροπή here in
Philo's sense, and translates obumbratio quae oritur ex inconstantia
necturae. This gives a very good sense, ‘ overshadowing of mutability,'
as one might speak of ‘ an overshadowing of disgrace ' : no changes in
this lower world can cast a shadow on the nnchanging Fount of light.
Or we may take τροπῆς as a qualitative genitive, and interpret as Stolz
does, after Luther, ‘keine abwechselnde Verdunkelung.' Beyschlag
maintains that this would require τροπὴ (1ἰττ-οο-κιοὶο-μοιτος,1 but why may
not ⁶ overshadowing of change ⁷ serve to express ⁶ changing shadow'
(Le. an overshadowing which changes the face of the sun), just as well
as ⁴ a hearer of forgetfulness ’ in ver. 25 to express ‘a forgetful hearer'
or ‘ the world of wickedness ' in iii. 6 to express ‘ the wicked world ’2
The meaning of the passage will then be ‘God is alike incapable of
change in his own nature (παραλλαγή) and incapable of being changed
by the action of others (ἀποσκίασμα).’ 011 the unchangeableness of
God compare Mal. iii. 6, Heb. xiii. 8. It is on this doctrine that Plato
founds his argument against the possibility of a Divine Incarnation
(Hel). ii. 380 foll.). See comment. Spitta takes τροπή of the Sun's
invisible return from west to east and ἀποσκίασμα of the darkness of
night.

18. βουληθεὶς ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς] So far from God tempting us to evil,
His will is the cause of our regeneration. It is the doctrine expressed
by St. Paul (Eph. i. 5) προορίσας ἡμᾶς εἷς υἱοθεσίαν διὰ Ἰ.Χ. εἷς αὐτόν, κατὰ
τὴν εὐδοκίαν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ, Rom. xii. 2 3 by St. Peter (i. 1. 3) ὃ
κατὰ τὸ πολὺ αὐτοῦ ἕλεος ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς εἷς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν and ver. 23 3
by St. John (i. 13) οἳ οὐκ ἐξ αἱμάτων οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς οὐδὲ ἐκ
θελήματος ἀνδρὸς ἀλλ’ ἐκ Θεοῦ ἐγεννήθησαν, and iii. 3-8, 1 ep. iv. 10.
As the seed of sin and death is contained in the nni-estrained indul-
gence of man’s ἐπιθυμία, so the seed of righteousness and life in the
word of God. For the general metaphor compare 1 John iii. 9 πᾶς
ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἁμαρτίαν οὐ ποιεῖ, ὅτι σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει,
καὶ οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτάνειν ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ γεγέννηται, Psa. lxxxvii. 4-6, IXXX.

σόφοις τὸ κατηχῆσαι καὶ φωτίσαι ἂναγεννῆσαι λέγεται, 1 Cor. iv. 15, and
a ,J ewish saying in Schiirer Hist. of Jewisla People‚ i. p. 317, Eng. tr.,
‘ A man’s father only brought him into this world ε his teacher, who
taught him wisdom, brings him into the life of the world to come‚’ 2
also Philo M. 1. p. 147 (αἱ ἀρεταὶ) μὴ δεξάμεναι παρά τινος ἑτέρου ἐπιγονὴν
ἐξ ἑαυτῶν μὲν μόνων οὐδέποτε κυήσουσι· τίς οῦν ὁ σπείρων ἐν αὐταῖς τὰ καλὰ
πλὴν ὁ τῶν ὅλων πατήρ, ib. 108 τὸν ἐγκύμονα θείων φώτων λόγον, ib. 123,
where the text Κύριος ἤνοιξε τὴν μήτραν Λείας is explained ὁ Θεὸς τὰς
μήτρας ἀνοίγει σπείρων ἐν αὐταῖς τὰς καλὰς πράξεις, ib. 273. The Choloe
of a word properly used of the mother is explained here by the refer-
ence to V. 15, but it may be compared with Deut. xxxii. 18 (R.V.),

1 B reads τροπῆς ἆποσκιοίσματος.
