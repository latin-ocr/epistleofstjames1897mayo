fesslon of religion (James i. 26, 27, Matt. vi. 1—7), the contrast be—
tween saying and doing (James i. 22-25, 11. 14-26, iii. 13, 18, Matt.
vii. 15-27), the true nature of prayer (566165 i. 5-8, iv, 3, V. 13-18,
Matt. vi. 6-13), the incompatibility between the 10176 of the world
and the love of God (5 ames 11. 5, 111. 6, iv. 4-8, Matt. 171. 24), the
need to forgive others if we would be forgiven ourselves (5611165 11.
12, 13, Mat-t. vi. 14, 15), the tree known by its fruits (5611165111. 11,
12, Matt. vii. 16-20), the interdiction of oaths (5 ames v. 12, Matt.
V. 34-37), and of censoriousness (James iv. 11, 12, Matt. vii. 1-5),
the praise of singleness of aim (J ames i. 8, iv. 8, Matt. vi. 22, 23).
It 15 to be noticed that, close as is the connexion of sentiment and
even of language in many of these passages, it never amounts to
actual quotation. It 15 like the reminiscence of thoughts often
uttered by the original speaker and sinking into the heart of the

places of Christ's teaching, the fundamental ideas with which he
commenced his ministry.

Mark xi. 23, 243 the royal law of 5611165 ii. 8 15 the same of
which 113 15 said in Matt. xxii. 39 that on it and its companion
law, which enjoins love to God, ‘hang all the law and the
prophets’3 the desire to be called Rabbi 15 condemned alike in
5611165 111. and Matt. xxiii. 8-12; the dangers of hasty speaking
are pointed out in 566165 111. 2 and in Matt. xii. 373 the Judge
‘ standeth before the door' in 5611165 17. 9, ‘he is nigh even at the
doors' in Matt. xxiv. 33, Mark xiii. 29 ; the woes denounced against
