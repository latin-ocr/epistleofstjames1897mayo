Mand. ii. 2 πρῶτον μὲν μηδενὸς καταλάλει μηδὲ ἡδέως ἄκουε καταλαλοῦντος
...πονηρὰ ἡ καταλαλιά, ἀκατάστατον δαιμόνιόν ἐστιν, μηδέποτε εἷρηνεῦον,
Clem. Rom. ii. 4 μὴ καταλαλεῖν ἀλλήλων, Earn. 20 εὐχερεῖς ἐν καταλαλιᾷ,
Test. Gad. 3 (ὁ μισῶν) τῷ κατορθοῦντι φθονεῖ, καταλαλιὰν ἀσπάζεται.
Field, Oc. Now„ quotes the definition κατάλαλοι : οἱ διαβολαῖς κατὰ
τῶν ἀπόντων ἀδεῶς κεχρημένοι. The word is not used by classica] writers.
This evil-speaking flows from the pride condemned in v. 16 and is an
expression of the hate denounoed in vv. 1, 2. It is shown in what
follows to imply a usurpation of God's right to judge.

ἀδελφώ] Τ116 three-sold repetition of the word in this sentence is in
part required by the different constructions of καταλαλῶ and κρίνω, like
the fourfold repetition of νόμος, but it also adds weight to the writer's
appeal to their feeling of brotherhood. The appeal is heightened in
the third case by the addition of τὸν ἀδ. αὐτοῦ, not simply a, but lais,
brother.

κρίνων τὸν αδελῴόν.] Compare ‘Matr vii. 1, Rom. ii. 1, 1 Cor. iV. 5.

καταλαλεῖ νόμου καὶ κρίνει νόμον] λλᾞοθνθὶ· deliberately breaks a laW
and does not repent of it, thereby speaks against it and treats it as a
bad law, since it is the 65561106 of a law to require obedienoe, and he
who refuses obedience virtually says it ought not to be laW. Thus he who
speaks against a brother virtually speaks against the law of brotherhood.
The law which the writer has in mind is the royal law spoken of in ii.
S, to which reference is made by the word πλησίον 111 ν. 12. The
offence against man is also an offence against God, cf. above iii. 9, Matt.
XXV. 42-45, 1 John iv. 20, Prov. xvii. 5, PS. xii. 4, Test. Gad. 4 φυλά-
ξασθε ἀπὸ τοῦ μίσους, ὅτι εἷς αὐτὸν τὸν κύριον ἀνομίαν ποιεῖ· οὗ γὰρ θέλει
ἀκούειν λόγων ἐντολῶν αὐτοῦ περὶ ἀγάπης τοῦ πλησίον. The phrase ‘ speaks

. against the law ' is evidently adapted to the special context, ef. i. 4

τέλειον and τέλειος, V. 11 μαρανθήσεται, VV. 12-14 πειράζω, 15 and IS
ἀπεκύησεν, iv. 1 στρατευομένων after πόλεμοι.

οὐκ εῖ ποιητὴς vop-om] ποιητὴς λόγου in 1. 22, see Rom. ii. 13, 1 EIaCC.
ii. 67. In Classical Greek the phrase is used for ‘ lawgiver,’ never for
‘ doer of the laW.⁷ The critical attitucle is averse to the dutiful per-
formanoe of the law. It is only by doing the will of God, so far as
it is known to us, that we learn to understand the reasons of it,
John vii. 17.

ἀλλὰ, κριτής] Of. Clem. Hom. xii. 26 foll. ‘ If you seek to benefit the
good only and not the bad, you undertake to perform the office of a
judge (κριτοῦ τὸ ἔργον) and not of kindness,' dvc„ Const. Apost. ii. 36
ἐὰν κρίνῃς τὸν ἀδελφὸν, κριτὴς ἐγένου, μηδενός σε προχειρισαμένου, τοῖς γὰρ
ἱερεῦσιν ἐπετράπη κρίνειν μόνοις.

12. εἷς ἔστιν νομοθέτης καὶ κριτής.] One who criticises the law is really
proposing to enact a better law 3 but there is only one lawgiver and
judge <John V. 22, 1 Cor. iv, 3-5‚ Taylor J.F, p. 83), viz. he who is
Lord of life and death, 226. whose sentence takes effect 3 just as he
who exercises the right of sovereignty is the ruler (Matt. xxii. 21).
The noun νομοθ έτης does not occur elsewhere in N.T:, though both
νομοθετέω and νομοθεσία are found. For κριτής 566 below v. 9.

ὀδυνάμενος σῶσαι καὶ ἀπολέσαι,] Cf. Dent. XXXii. 39, Psa. lxviii.
