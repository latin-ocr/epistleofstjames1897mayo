gather the existence of any established or authorized tradition
in favour of the Epiphanian view. We have seen also that both
Origen and 5 erome trace back the origin of this view to the
Apocryphal Gospels, and that Jerome puts forward his own view
as an entirely novel hypothesis. I think therefore we may
conclude that, setting aside these Gospels, there was no fixed
recognized tradition on the subject before the end 01 1116 fourth
century, though there was a growing feeling in favour of the per-
petual virginity‚ which took definite shape in the title άειπαρθένος
used of Mary by Athanasius3 and the apocryphal fictions were
eagerly embraced as affording a support for this belief. 56101116’5
view, being still more in accordance with the ascetic views of the
time, was adopted by Augustine and the Latin Fathers gener-
ally 3 while in the Eastern Church‚ Chrysostom, who, in his earlier
writings‚ favours the Epiphaniam view, comes round to 56101116 111
1116 later. The subsequent Greek F 6111615 are, however, almost all on
the side of Epiphanius; and the Greek, Syrian, and Coptic Calen-
dars mark the distinction between 5 611165 1116 brother of the Lord
and 5 611165 the son of Alphaeus by assigning a separate day to each.
This distinction is also maintained, apart from any statement as to
the exact relationship implied by the term ‘ brothers in the Clemen—
tine Homz'lies and Recogym'tions of the second century, and the
Apostolic constitutions of the third.

A short abstract 01 the argument of Epiphanius will show us
the grounds on which he relied‚ and will also furnish an interesting
specimen 01 tradition in the making. It is contained in the third

book of 1115 Parammon, Haer. lxxviii. (Agyaz'nst tlte Adversaries of

Mary) p. 1037 1011.

111 this age 01 heresy, he says, while some have ventured to propagate
errors about the Trinity, others have turned their assaults against τῆς ἁγίας·
Μαρίας, τῆς ἀειπαρθένου. Surely her very name is enough to eonfute them.
As Abraham is always the F riend of God, 5611165 and 501111 always Sons 01
Thunder, so Mary always the Virgin. The assertion that she ever ceased to
be a virgin shows a want 01 knowledge of Scripture and of history. For first
of all it was determined by lot that she should be delivered to 50561111, a
widower of eighty years, for the purpose of protection, not of marriage.1 This
J oseph was brother of Clopas and son of Jacob surnamed Panther. His first
wife was of the tribe of J udah and by her 116 had six children, the eldest
Jacob, surnamed Oblias and Just, the first to whom the Lord entrusted the
episcopal throne, then J oses, Simeon, J udas, Mary, and Salome as we learn
from Scripture (p. 1041). Epiphanius then lays stress on the use of the word
