given form of words is both necessary to, and sufficient for salvation,
and that heterodoxy is the worst of 51115.

We are not to suppose however that St. James would in these words
discourage the wish to arrive at a clear intellectual view in religion.
Τ 116 ‘word which is able to save the soul’ is itself addressed in the
first instance to the understanding, though it must penetrate the whole
nature before its work can be accomplished. It no less belongs to
man, as a rational being to think clearly, than it belongs to him, as a
moral being, to act riylctly. ‘ I will pray with the spirit ' says St. Paul,
‘ but I will pray with the understanding also ' : and St. Peter, or whoever
is the author of the second Epistle which goes under his name, warns
us of the danger arising from the misunderstanding of the written
word, where he speaks of the hard things contained in St. Paul’s
epistles, ‘ which they that are unlearned and ignorant wrest, as they do
also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction? To grasp fully
the meaning of each separate statement, as intended by 13116 writer and
understood by the original reade1s‚ will often tax our powers to
the utmost, and we have besides to consider how far each separate
statement is 130 be qualified or limited 01 balanced by 0131161 statement's,
whether in the same book 01 111 the other Scriptures5 and again how
far changed circumstances, changed modes of thought and expression,
necessitate a change in the form of the doctrine taught 3—before we can
be sure of what is the actual teaching of the Spirit to the Church in
our own day. It is from neglecting these things, from the misunder-
standing of forms of speech, or from fixing the mind exclusively on
one side of Christian teaching, that erroneous views as to the Sacra-
ments and as to Predestination have become so widely prevalent. lt
was therefore only natural and right that the Catholic Church should
seek to guard against the misinterpretation of revealed truth, first, by
drawing up short summaries of the essentials of belief for the use of all
her members, and secondly by careful exposition of the teaching of the
Bible on particular doctrines, made by the most learned of her sons. St.
J ames is not of course to be regarded 65 objecting to such formularies
or treatises. It is not the creed he finds fault with, but the belief
that 6 111611 15 saved by the correctness of his cr eed.

Everoeffly extreme in religion is 51116 to give rise to the opposite
ext] eme. If therefore one party exaggerate the importance of a correct
statement of Christian truth, and make this correctness consist in 6
iepetition of phrases devised by the Fathers of the fourth or of some
latei century, rather than in the actual teaching of Christ and his
Apostles, if they restrict the freedom of thought by unwarrantable
assertions that the Church has already arrived at absolute truth, and
that the duty of reason is not to question, but simply to bow down in
adoration of a mystery 3 it was to be expected that another party
would spring up, who would not only deny that the Church had any
right to put out an authoritative statement of doctrine, but would also
deny the possibility of arriving at any conclusion whatever in matters
of theology‚ and even that there was any connexion between doctrine
and conduct. Such persons might be disposed to claim the authority
