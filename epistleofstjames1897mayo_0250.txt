of doctrine receives the sanie dramatic treatment, eg. i. 13 ‘Let
no man say when he is tempted ὅτι ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι’; and so
in ii. 18 foll. where the vanity of faith without works is exposed3
and iv, 13 foll. where the worldly feeling on one side, and the reli-
gious feeling on the other, are embodied in the contrasted speeches,
‘To-day or to-morrow we will go to this city, and spend a year
there, and trade and get gain,' and again ‘If the Lord will, we
shall live and do this or that? In further illustration of what I

j understand by the quality of vividness 1 will only instance the
frequent reference to examples, such as Abraham, Rahab, Job‚
Elijah3 and the personification of the Law in iv. 11, of the Tongue
in iii. 1—8. Suffice it to say that it pervades the whole of the
Epistle‚ and 15 markedly seen in the detailed particularity of the
descripffions, such as that of the oppression of the rich in v. 1—6.
All this tends to give vivacity and energy to the style. Other
causes of vivacity are the appealing ἀδελφοί μου, and the very
frequent use of interrogation and of the imperative mood. It is
scarcely worth while to quote, but I will Just refer to v. 13 ‘Is
any among you suffering? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let
him sing praise. Is any among you sickZ let him call for the
elders of the Church': for the imperative, compare i. 2 and
following verses, πᾶσαν χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε-ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ ἔργον
τέλειον ἐχέτω-αἰτείτω--μὴ οἰέσθω-καυχάσθω. Compare too
the sudden apostrophes, μὴ ,πλανᾶσθε-ἴστε-ἀκούσατε--θέλεις
δὲ Ὑνῶναι-βλέπεις-ὁρᾶτε-ἴδε--ἰδού-ἄΎε νυν.

111 specifying energy as the prominent feature of St. ›James‘
style, 1 mean that, whatever he says, he says forcibly, with the
tone of one who is entirely convinced both of the truth and of
the importance of the message which he has to deliver. He
wastes no words; he uses no circumlocution; at times, as in ii.
1, he even becomes obscure from over—condensation3 he pays no
more regard to the persons of men that did Elijah or John the
Baptist. We feel, as we read, that we are in the presence of a

Χ strong, stern, immovable personality, a true pillar1 and bulwark 2
⁷ of the Church, one in whom an originally proud and passionate
nature, richly endowed with a high poetical imagination and all a
prophet’s indignation against wrong-doing and hypocrisy‚ is now
softened and controlled by the gentler influences of the wisdom
