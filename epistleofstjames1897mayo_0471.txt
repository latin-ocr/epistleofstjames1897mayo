sign that God neglects them; yet they are 10 rejoice in this trouble
with its attendant temptation, because in this way their faith
will be strengthened, and they will learn endurance. In such a
case as this it might be said, either that Satan tempted them by
Divine appoffltment, or that God tempted them through 8616010
agency. The difference of expression in 2 86111. xxiv, 1 and 1 Chron.
xxi. 1 is due to the idiosyncrasy of the writers, the later writer shrink-
ing from the bold anthropomorphism of the earlier. There is more
difficulty in the passage in which God is said to have hardened
Pharaoh's 116611, especially if we read it with 81. Ρ6111’6 commentary
(Rom. ix. 17-04) ‘ whom he will, he hath mercy on, and whom he will,
he hardeneth‚' and his silencing of the objector by what looks like an
appeal to unlimited power ί811611 1116 thing formed say 10 11101 11161
formed it Why hast thou made me thus? ' It is no doubt in reference
10 60011 6 passage that we read that the epistles of St. Paul contained
‘ things hard 10 106 understood which they that are unlearned and un-
stable wrest 10 111611 own destruction.⁷ Perhaps it 16 most easily ex-
plained by regarding 113 66 an abbreviated way of saying that Pharaoh’s
hardness was 1116 natural consequence of 1116 Divine law which has
ordained that prolonged resistance 10 conscience should result in 1116
searing of the 116611, 6001 11161 11116 hardness was also part of the
providentia] plan by which Israel was brought out of Egypt and the
power of God manifested. It is not meant that Pharaoh was under
any compulsion 10 sin, or that God tempted him 10 sin. Lastly the
argument of 81. Paul 16 more justly regarded as an appeal 10 01611’6
ignorance than as an 6666111011 of the doctrine that might makes right.
Throughout the Bible God's claim to man's obedience is founded on
His righteousness. The faith of Abraham rests on this foundation.

Paul as well 66 of Moses, no miracle‚ no sign of power could justify
the Israelite or the Christian in accepting a doctrine different from
that which he had received from Him whose name is Holy.

Setting aside however the precise language of Scriptum, does not
experience show cases in which it might be said that man is tempted
cf Godtt Take the child of criminal or vicious parents. He inherits
a special predisposition 10 evil, and he is placed in circumstances which
encourage and call out that tendency. Here we have to consider (1) the
teaching of our Lord with regard to the many stripes and few stripes.
Guilt is very different according to the different degi-ees of light
accorded. But (2) every one has received some measure of light from
above, teaching him that there 16 a right and a wrong, and further
light and strength are given in proportion 66 1116 existing light is used.
