II 1, 2] NOTES 79*

pares Matt. xviii. 20 ‘theie am I, in the midst of them. ’1 [Spittae
thinks the difficulty of construction betrays the interpolation of ἡμῶν
’.Ι Χ. by the Christian editor (see above Intr od. 011. vii. ) and cites the
following eXX. of the use of‘ ο Κύριος τῆς δόξης foi Jehovah from Enoch:

xxii. 14 ηὖλόγησα τ. Κύριον της δόξης, XXV. 3 ὁ μέγας Κύριος τῆς δόξης,
ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ αἰῶνος, also XXV. 7, xxvii. 3, 5]

2. εἰς συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν.] Eithei‘ to a meeting of your,'s or ‘into your
synagogue ’the article being omitted according to Hellenistic 1150, as
in v. 20 ἐκ πλάνης αὐτοῦ. The word is used of a distinctively Christian
assembly by Hermas 11Ιαηεῑ.Χ1. 9 (11111011 a man having the Spiiit of
(11οᾶ Comes) εἷς συναγωγην ἀνδρῶν δικαιων...καὶ ἔντευξις γένηται πρὸς τὸν
Θεὸν τῆς συναγωγῆς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων (there the power of the Spirit is
manifested). In the note Harnack says that the word 15 used in the
earlier Greek only in active sense of ‘bringing togethe1¹,' but by
Jewish writers of the apostolic age (1) of the religious community, (2)
of the religious assembly‚ (3) of the place of assembly. It alternates
with ἐκκλησία 111 the LXX„ bnt the latter soon became the predominant
and distinctive term among the ChristianS, συναγωγή being contrasted
with it, as denoting an assembly of Jews or hereticS, cf. Apoc. ii. (Δ,
111. 9 συναγωγὴ τοῦ Σατανᾶ, and many passages cited by Hal-nack from
Tertullian, Irenaeus, Clem. AL, Apost. Constitt. It seems however
that the Christians of J udaea retained the wider use, after it had been
abandoned elsewher‚e as Epiphanius XXX. 18 says of the Ebionites
συναγωγὴν οὑτοι καλοῖσι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἐκκλησιαν και οὐχὶ ἐκκλησίαι
(Lightfoot Pleilzpp. p. 100) It is also found loosely used by other
Christian writers in the 501150 of‘ gathering' (ἐπισυναγωγή Heb. X.
25),115 Ignat. Polyc. iv. 2 πυκνότερον συναγωγαι γινέσθωσαν(Ξ Didache
Χν1.2 πυκνῶς συναχθήσεσθε), Tl1e0ph.ad Amol. ii. 14 δεδωκενε o Θεὸς
τῷ κόσμῳ.. ,τὰς συναγωγὰς, λεγομενας δὲ ἐκκλησίας ἁγιας, Clem. Al.
Sto om. Vi. 4, p. 756 ἀλήθεια οὐρανόθεν ἄνωθεν ἐπὶ την συναγωγὴν τῆς
ἐκκλησίας ἀφιγμένη, Const. Apostol. iii. 6,οῧ γὰρ επὶ τὸ κοιι ον τῆς
συναγωγης ἀνάπαυμα ἐν τῇ κυριακῇ καταντῶσιν. Some have supposed that
συναγωγή should be taken 111 its ordinary sense of a J ewish synagogue,
the epistle having been written at a time when the separation of
Christians from Jews was not completely effected. Compare NVestcott
Hel). p. xxxviii. ‘ For a time the fellowship of the church and synagogue
was allowed on both sides. Little by little the growth of the Gentile
element in the church excited the active hostility of the Jews against
the whole body of Christians, as it troubled the J ewish converts then]r
selves. This hostility could not fail to be intensified in Palestine by
the spread of aggressive nationalism there shortly before the outbreak
of the J ewish war. . . . When as yet the national unbelief of the Jews
was undeclared it was not possible to foresee that the coming of Christ
would bring the overthrow of the old order. The approaching catas-
trophe was not realized in the earlier apostolic writings. In the

1 Dclitzscli‚ in his story on Jerusalem in ‘the time of the Herods, says with
reference to this verse of Aboth, ‘ they had often felt 111 past (lays that the Shekinah
was 111 their midst, but now this gracious Presence assumed bodily form 111 the
personxof ι105115, as the Messiah of Israel’—(shor'cened from English tr. p. 121).
