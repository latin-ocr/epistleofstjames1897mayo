140 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

on the ground that we cannot suppose St. J ames to have spoken of God
stS acting πρὸς φθόνον, just after he had condemned this feeling in man
(reading φθονεῖτε ver. 26). But we have seen that it is acharacteristic
of the writer to use the same word both in a good and bad sense (πίστις,
πειρασμός, σοφία), cf. Comm. on Faith below.

6. μείζονα. δὲ δίδωσιν χάριν] More, 111 consequence of this jealous affec-
tion, which shows itself not in the abandonment of the unfaithful
sponse, but in further bounteousness 3 cf. Isa. liv. 7, 8 ‘for a small
moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will Ι gather thee,'
&c., ix. 6, 7, on the effect of the Divine ⁶ jealousy,' Zech. i. 14, viii. 2,
where the declaration of God's jealousy of Zion is followed by
promises of her future glory. The absolute sels-surrender demanded
of the Christian is rewarded by richer supplies of divine grace than he
could otherwise receive. For the pregnant use of μείζων cf. above i. 12.

διὸ λέγει.] The subject understood is probably God, as above i. 12·
ἐπηγγείλατο, and Eph. iv. 8, v. 14, where the same phrase occurs 3 others
take it as ἡ γραφή, cf. above ver. 5.

ὁ Θεὸς ὑπερηῲάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται ταπεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσιν wifam] Cited in the
same form 1 Pet. v, 5. The LXX. (Prov. iii. 34) has Κύριος for Θεός.
Clement of Rome (1. 30), who also has Θεός, 1133 probably borrowed the
quotation from St. James, as his next sentence reminds us of our epistle,
καταλαλιᾶς πόρρω ἑαυτοὺς ποιοῦντες, ἔργοις δικαιούμενοι καὶ οὐ λόγοις.. For
ἀντιτ. ‘sets himself against ' see Acts xviii. 6, Rom. xiii. 2. For
ὑπερηφ. ‘conspicuous beyond others‚' ‘outshining them,’ and so ‘ proud,
⁴ liaughty,' 1 See Sirao. X. 7 μισητὴ ἔναντι Κυρίου καὶ ἀνθρώπων ὑπερηφανία,
ib. ver. ]2 ἀρχὴ ὑπερηφανίας ἀνθρώπου ἀφισταμένου ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου,
καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν ἀπέστη ἡ καρδία atros, V. 18 οὐκ ἔκτισται
ἀνθρώποις ὑπερηφανία, Ρ331111. Sol. ii. 25, iv. 28, where it is used of
defiant wickedness. In St. Peter the quotation simply enforces
an exhortation to humility, ‘ be humble‚ for grace follows ' : here
we have to suppose ὑπερηφανία (‘ pride of life,’ 1 John i. 16)
identified with ἡ φιλία τοῦ κόσμου in v. 4, 333 the passage just
quoted from Sirac. X. 12. The friend of the world is proud because
he makes himself his own centre, disowning his dependence upon God,
see Trench Syn. p. 113 foll., Cheyne ou Isaiah ii. 12.

7. ὑποτάγητε] A favourite word with St. Peter.

ἀντίστητε δὲ τῷ διαβόλῳ] Opposed first to the previous clause, and
then the addition of καὶ φεύξεται suggests a new contrast to the clause⁴
Which follows. Compare the parallel passage in 1 Pet. V. 8, 9, also Eph.
vi. 11, 12. The devil is the ἅρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου (above ver. 4, John
xiv, 30), he inspires hatred and discord (above iii. 15, John viii. 44), the
proud fall into his condemnation (above ver. 6, 1 Tim. iii. 6).

καὶ φεύξεται ἀφ’ tyrow] The imperative followed by καὶ 13 311 enei-getic
form of the conditional sentence, see A. Buttmann, p. 196, and compare
John ii. 19 λύσατε τὸν ναὸν καὶ ἐγερῶ αὐτόν, also below VV. S, lO. The
promise gives an answer to those who might plead in excuse the power
of the tempter, as others pleaded the force of circumstances ordained

1 It seems to be derived from the adjectiva] form ὕπερος and φαίνω like ἐλαφηβόλος
from ἔλαφος and βάλλω.
