TO WHOM THE EPISTLE IS ADDRESSED cxvii

Antioch in Pisidia it was the higher class of proselytes who were
stirred up by the Jews to expel Paul out of their coasts (Acts
xiii. 50). Scin the Book of Enoch the Sadducees are referred to
as wealthy oppressors, xciv. 6 foll„ xcvii. 8-10.

It is easy to understand this hostility of the richer and more
powerful Jews to the Christians. The prosperous and well-to-doi
are naturally suspicious of reformers ι and Christ and His disciples
were reformers of a very thorough-going kind. They preached Ἰ
that the kingdom of heaven was for the poor, that it was easier for
a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven. The rich man who would enter
therein must no longer count his riches his own ; he must sell all
that he had and give to the poor3 he must glory no longer in
wealth and station, but in having learnt that his superiority only
marked him out as intended by God to be the minister and servant
of all (James i. 10, Mark x, 43, 44). But there were other and
more special grounds for the hatred entertained by the chief priests
and Pharisees for the name of Christ. On two separate occasionsl¹

xChrist had openly denounced the buying and selling which was
carried on in the Temple under the sanction and for the profit of
the worldly-niinded and avaricious priests and their partisans: in
his parable of the Vineyard and the Husbandmen he had prophe-
sied their speedy overthrow ; and St. Luke concludes his narratives f)
of the two incidents in much the same words, ‘the chief priests
and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him '
(Luke xix. 47, xx. 19, 20). Even more scathing was his de-
nunciation of the intellectual aristocracy, ‘Woe unto you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites.' As he had weighed humble poverty in
the balance against sels-satisfied wealth, so he weighed modest
ignorance against sels-satisfied learning in the words ‘ I thank thee,
O Father‚ because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent and hast revealed them unto babes'; and even went so
far as to declare that the publican and harlot were nearer to the
kingdom of God than the sels-righteous Pharisee. Yet again, the
Sadducees' disbelief in the resurrection was directly challenged by
the declaration of the Apostles that they were themselves eye-
witnesses of the resurrection of Christ.

Pharisaic Judaism found definite expression in the teaehing of the Hellenistic
