72 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

ἐν τῖ’ ποιήσει.] Only here in N.T. It occurs in Sir. xix. 18 ἐν πάσῃ
σοφίᾳ ποίησις νόμου, li. 19 ἐν ποιήσει νόμου διηκριβωσάμην.

“ 2 6. δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εῖναι.] Here we have another source of seli-deception,
not in hearing, but in saying and doing. Cf. Erasmus ε Qui Judaismum
sapiunt relsz'yz'oozis laudem constituunt in palliis ac phylacteriis, in delectu
ciborum, in lotionibus, in prolixis precibus ceterisque ceremoniis. Δοκεῖ
15 used in N.T. either impersonally = (1) ‘seems ⁷ as Acts XXV. 27
ἄλογόν μοι δοκεῖ, (2) ‘seems good' as Luke 1. 3 ἔδοξε κάμοί; or per-
sonally (l) of others, Acts xvii. 18 ξένων δαιμονίων δοκεῖ καταγγελεὺς
εἶναι, (2) of a man's self, ‘think' as here. In this last meaning
the word is used absolutely (ιι) Matt. xxiv, 44 ᾗ ὥρᾳ οὐ δοκεῖτε; or
(b) With ὅτι Matt. Vi. 7 δοκοῦσιν ὅτι εἶσακουσθήσονταιτ or (ο), as
here, with infinitive relating to same subject, cf. John v, 39 δοκεῖτε ἐν
»αὐταῖς ζωὴν ἔχειν, 1 Cor. 111. 18 εἴ τις δοκεῖ σοφὸς εἶναι, ib. viii. 2,
x. 12, xiv. 37, Gal. vi. 3. In some cases (eg. Gai. ii. 6, Phil. iii. 4>
it is disputed whether ‘seem' or ‘think’ is the right rendering.
Here the question is decided by the following ἀπατῶν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ.

Θρησκός.] ἇπ. λεγ. The word θρησκεία occurs Acts XXVi. 5 κατὰ τὴν
ἀκριβεστάτην αἵρεσιν τῆς ἡμετέρας θρησκείας ἔζησα Φαρισαῖος, Col. 11. IS
θρησκεία τῶν ἀγγέλων, and ‘the compound ἐθελοθρησκεία (sels-imposed
worship) Col. ii. 23, where see Lightfoot: also in Wisd. xiv. 18 and
27 ἡ τῶν εἰδώλων θρησκεία, in 4 BIacc. V. 6 τῇ Ἰουδαίων χρώμενος
θρησκεία, ib. v. 12, and in Josephus 1 Ant. iv, 4. 4 τοῖς κατ’ οἷκον θύουσιν
εὐωχίας ἕνεκα τῆς αὑτῶν ἀλλὰ μὴ θρησκείας, ib. V. 1Ο. 1 γυναῖκας τὰς ἐπὶ
θρησκείᾳ παραγινομένας, ib. iX. 13. 3 (of the priests) ἵνα ἀεὶ τῇ θρησκείᾳ
παραμένωσι ‘that they may always reinain in attendance on public
worship,' ib. xii. 5. 4 and xii. 6. 2. Philo carefully distinguishes the
term from εὐσέβεια and ὁσιότης (Μ. 1. 195) πεπλάνηται τῆς πρὸς εὐσέβειαν
ὁδοῦ, θρησκείαν ἀντὶ ὁσιότητος ἡγούμενος καὶ δῶρα τῷ ἀδεκάστῳ διδούς, and
so Plut. V . Alex. 2 (where he gives the derivation from Θρῇσσα, which
seems to have suggested to Dr. Hilgenfeld his strange idea that θρησκός
15 an Orphio word borrowed by St. J ames) δοκεῖ τὸ θρησκεύειν ὄνομα ταῖς
κατακόροις γενέσθαι καὶ περιέργοις ἱερουργίαις. Dr. Hatch sums up the
result of his investigation (Le. p. 57) in the words ‘religion in its

> external aspect, as worship or as one mode of worship contrasted with
another, must be held to be its meaning in the N.T. as in contemporary
writers.' I subjoin some exalnples from later writers, J ustin. M. Cela.
