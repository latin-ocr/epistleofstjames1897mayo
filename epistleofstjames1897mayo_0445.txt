ἀλείψαντες ἐλαίῳ] Anointing the sick was customary, see D. of B.
under ⁴ Medicine ' and also vol. iii. p. 395, and for instances Isa. i. 6
Luke x. 34. Herod in his last 11111055 was recommended a bath of 011
by his physieians (Jos. B.J. i. 33. 5). The medicina] properties of 011
aie also praised by Philo (Somn. Μ. 1. 666), Pliny (N. H. xxiii. 34- 50),
and Galen (ssled. Temp. bk. ii..) The lattel calls ib ἄριστον ἰαμάτων
πάντων τοῖς ἐξηραμμει οις καὶ αὖχμώδεσι σώμασιν. Here the anointing iS
aeoompanied by a miraculous healing in answer to prayer, as we
ale told of the Twelve (Mark Vi. 13) ἤλειφον ἐλαίῳ πολλους ἀρρώσ-
τους καὶ ἐθεράπευον. Nobhing is speoified as 130 1110 use 01 011 111
13110 promise recorded by 13110 same Evangelisb (xvi. 18) ἐπὶ ἀρρώστους
χεῖρας ἐπιθήσουσιν καὶ καλῶς ἕξουσιν, 01· in Acbs xxviii. 8, where St. Paul
is said 130 have healed 13110 father 01 Publius by prayer and ‘ohe laying
on 01 hands. In 13110 011111-011 01 001111111 (1 001. Χ11. 9) gifts 01 healing
(χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων) are menbioned along wibh the other manifestations

be witnessed in his day, α”λλοι τοὺς κάμνοντας διὰ τῆς τῶν χειρῶν ἐπιθέσεως

contemporary miracles (Civ. l). xxii. 8) only once mentions 13110 1150 01
011. 011 'ohe 0131101· ha nd Tei tullian (ad Scap. 4) says Septimius Severus
was 0111 ed with 011 by ‘che Christian Proculus , and in 13110 Gospel of

Haeres. 16, Epiphan. Haeres. xxx. 2) says that the Gnostie. 5001] 01 the
Heracleonites anointed 13110 dying with 011 and water ‘co protect ‘chem
from hostile spirits in 13110 other world. Chrysostom, Hom. 3 in Allan.
(Migne Patrol. Gr. vol. 57, 001. 384), magnifying the sanetity of Church
vessels generally, sayS, 1311050 know how far our lamps surpass all others

which 113 15 1111011οᾶ that 1110 011 for anointing 13110 sick was taken from
the lamps used in church, as is 513111 the custom in tho Greek 01101011, 01.

Τ1115 may be compared wibh Chrys. Hom. in llart. (Patr. vol. 50. 001.
664), where he recommends, as a remedy against· drunkenness‚ the
anoin‘cing 01 13110 body with 011 taken from 13110 martyrs' tombs. So 13110
