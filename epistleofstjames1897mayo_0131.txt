THE CONTENTS OF THE EPISTLE cxi

up3 if they draw nigh to Him, He will draw nigh to them (iv. 7-1 Ο).
Here, too, we may be helpful to one another by mutual confession,
and by prayer for one another. Great is the power of prayer
prompted by the Spirit of God (v. 15-20).

It is characteristic of the austere tone of the Epistle that it,
alone of the Epistles of the New Testament‚ contains no attempt
to conciliate the favour of the readers by direct words of praise.
In it we hear the bracing call of duty uttered by one who speaks
with earnest sympathy indeed and without a particle of Pharisaic
assumption, but who feels that he has the right to speak and
expects to be obeyed.1

1 Zahn (Skizzcn p. 50) remarks on the fact that St. James does not suggest any
legislative or social change. He does not tell the rich to restore the early communism
of the Church and share their wealth with the poor. In describing ,Christian per-
fection he does not recall the words of Christ, ‘If thou wilt be perfect, scll what
thou hast and give to the poor.’ He insists only on change of heart and motiva on
learning to estimate aright the value of life and of its accessor-ies, and to look forward
to the future judgment. He teaches both rich and poor what really constitutes the
title to honour and respect. It is not left to the community or to officials to
alleviata the distress of others, whether bodily or mental. All Christians are
exhorted to visit the sick, seed the hungry, convert the erring, pray for all. The
‘vVord of Truth lays down no precise rule as to social organization.
