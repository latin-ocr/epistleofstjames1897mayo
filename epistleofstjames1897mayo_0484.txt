it is so easy, so comforting to be a good hater, to take for granted
that one’s own side has a monopoly of intellect and virtue, to·
accept the party watch-word and join in shouting the party war-
cry3 so arduous and so humbling to divest oneself of prejudice, to
seek the truth for its own sake, to acknowledge the evil in ourselves,
and see the good in those who differ from us.

MODEs or SELF-DECEPTION.

St. James notices in this chapter four ways in which men may
delude themselves as regards their religious state in God's sight, and
preach peace to themselves when there is no peace. The first is by
their fiuency in speaking on religious subjects, the second by their
religious zeal, the third by their pleasure in hearing sermons or
reading religious books, the fourth (see verses 26 and 27) by the
punctiliousness of their religious services. Not that any one of these
is in itselt' wrong; they may be all good and right as means of grace3
but they are easily capable of becoming a source of sels-delusion‚
because it is so easy to confound the means with the end. Thus
under the old dispensation, Isaiah (i. 10-20) was commissioned to
declare the utter worthlessness of sacrifices and incense, of sabbaths
and holidays, of solemn meetings and many prayers‚ unless they were
accompanied by a moral change, unless the worshippers ceasecl to do
evil, and learnt to do well‚—a change exemplified in Isaiah, as in
St. James, by kindness shown to the orphan and the widow. In
like manner Micah (vi. 6 foll.) contrasts the externalities of a
sacrificial worship with that which the Lord requires, justice, mercy,
humility. The same contrast is found in the New Testament‚ as
in John iv. 20-24‚ where Christ himself corrects the Samaritan
woman's ideas of the special sanctity attaching to one place above
another, in the words ‘God is a Spirit, and they that worship
him must worship him in spirit and in truth' ,- and again in Matt. vii.
21-23, where He declares that, to many who have prayed and
prophesied and wrought miracles in His name, it shall hereafter be
said ‘I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.'
In his next chapter St. James specifies a fifth mode of self-deception,
arising from confidence in the orthodoxy of our creed ε ‘ thou believest
that there is one God3 thou doest well: the devils also believe, and
tremble.' To all these various semblances of religion—not necessarily
hypocritical semblances, for it is not a seeming to‘others‚ but a seeming
to self, which is condemned in the εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι of the 26th
verse—he opposes the reality‚ οὐ γὰρ δοκεῖν ἄριστος ἀλλ’ εἶναι θέλω.
