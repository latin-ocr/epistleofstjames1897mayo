V 12-20 SWEARING 225

SWEARING.

From the form of the prohibition, we might suppose that St. James
took the same view of the subject as St. Augustine, quoted in the
note, and forbade swearing, not so much because it was wrong in
itself, as because it was likely to lead to wrong, and therefore to con-
demnation. He could not have said of murder ‘Do not kill lest you
fall under condemnation.’ At any rate by giving his warning in this
form he made it easier for the Jews to accept it. VVhatever their
practice was, they would certainly allow that there was much careless
and irreverent swearing, and that this could not but be displeasing to
God. St. James is, however, quoting Christ's own words, and it is
therefore probable that he means ‘ What-‚ever form of oath you
use, it will come under the prohibition of Christ.' Are we to
understand from this that every kind of swearing is absolutely for-
bidden, that the Quakers, for instance, were right in refusing to take
an oath in a court of justice? This is not what we should gather
from the conduct of St. Paul and of Christ Himself. The former calls
God to witness that he is speaking the truth in more than one passage
(2 Cor. i. 23, xi. 31, Gal. i. 20, eto), and our Lord took the oath proposed
to Him in the words of the High Priest ‘ I adjure thee by the living
God! So the angel in the Apocalypse is represented as swearing ‘ by
Him that liveth for ever and ever.' The same rule of interpretation
must be applied here as in the case of the other precepts of the Sermon
on the Mount. They supply an ideal standard, a goal to be aimed at,
but not a code of law to be immediately put into execution, regardless
of existing circumstances, and of the manner in which their exact
observance would affect our carrying out the two great commandments
on which hang all the law and the prophets Take for instance the
precept to turn the other cheek : if this is tried by the principle that

Δ we should do to others as we would wish them 130 do to us, it is evident

that the last thing which a sane man could wish for himself or for one
whom he loved would be that he should be allowed to strike and
insult others with impunity. We have to disregard the letter, in
order to keep the spirit of the precept, which is, that a Christian
should never act from mere vindictiveness The law of love requires
us to act for the best interest of the offender, i.e. to act in such a way
as to induce him to avoid such faults in future. It is only where there
is sufficient generosity of character to make a man ashamed of striking
one who offers no resistance, that non-resistance becomes the fitting
course for a Christian, the right way of obeying the law ‘Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.5 Yet in proportion as a society becomes Chris-
tianized, it becomes more and more possible to practice non-resistance
without transgressing the higher law of love, which bids us always act
for the best interest of our neighbour. So with swearing: the right
state in a Christian community is that all should feel so strongly the
obligation of truth, that there should be no occasion for further sanc-
tion beyond the simple ‘yes’ and ‘n0.' Wherever there is need of
more ‘it comes of evil.' But often the standard of truthfulness is so
