ORDER or WORDs.

(1) of substantive and attribute ; (2) of governing and governed
nouns 3 (3) of subject and predicate3 (4) of governing verb and
case3 (5) of interrogative particle.

(1) The adjective generally follows immediately on its sub-
stantive, as in i. 4· ἔργον τέλειον, 1. 8 ἀνὴρ δίψυχος, ii. 2 ἀνὴρ
χρυσοδακτύλιος, 11. 2 ε’σθῆτι λαμπρᾷ, but we find also the
adjective preceding in i. 12 μακάριος ἀνήρ, 111. 2 τέλειος ἀνήρ,
ii. 2 ῥυπαρᾷ ἐσθῆτι, &c., and always in the case of πᾶς. It is
unusual for the substantive to be separated from the adjective by
an intervening verb, (except in the case of the substantive verb)
as in i. 2 ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπέσητε ποικίλοις, iv. 6 μείζονα
δίδωσιν χάριν, 111. 13 γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ, iv. 12 εἷς ἔστιν νομο-
θέτης, v. 17 Ἠλείας ἄνθρωπος ἧν ὁμοιοπαθὴς ἡμῖν. In these
cases the adjective is made more prominent by separation, though
it is probable that a feeling of rhythm had a good deal to do with
the departure from the usual order.

(2) Omitting the genitive of the prononn, which has been
already dealt with, we find the genitive placed immediately after
the governing noun in 50 cases as compared with three in which
it precedes, the latter being i. 1 Θεοῦ δοῦλος, 111. 3 τῶν ἵππων τοὺς
χαλινούς, 1. 17 τροπῆς· ἀποσκίασμα. In one instance the governing
noun is separated by an intervening verb from the governed, τὴν
γλῶσσαν οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων, Where greater
emphasis is given to ἀνθρώπων by its position.

(3) Where the subject (not being a relative pronoun) is
expressed, it precedes the predicative verb in about 55 cases, and
follows it in about 20. When the predicate is expressed by the
substantive verb and complement, the subject precedes the verb in
about 16 cases and follows in about 8. I do not here take note of
cases in which the verb is omitted, for which see Ellipsz's above. As
a rule the subject precedes the complement (predicative substantive
or adjective), but we have the following exceptions: i. 26 μάταιος
ἡ θρησκεία, 1. 27 θρησκεία καθαρὰ αὕτη ἐστίν, 11. 19 εἷς ἐστὶν
ὁ θεός, iii. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ γλῶσσα καθίσταται, v. 11
πολύσπλαγχνός ἐστιν ὁ Κύριος. In oblique predication, where
subject and complement come under the government of a
causative verb, we find the predicative noun preceding in i. 27
ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν, V. 10 ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τῆς κακοπαθίας·
