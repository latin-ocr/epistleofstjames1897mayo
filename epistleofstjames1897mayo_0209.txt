ON THE GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMES clxxxix

δια, 13 pure religion‚' cf. Acts ix. 15 σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς ἐστί μοι
οὗτος, John 1. 19 αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰωάννου. We have
examples of oblique predication in i. 27 ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν,
v. 10 ὑπόδειγμα λάβετε τῆς κακοπαθίας τοὺς προφήτας, and
ii. 5 οὐχ ὁ Θεὸς ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους
ἐν πι’στει,· ‘has not God chosen the poor 10 1116 world (to be)
rich in faith 2 ’ The article however may be used with the
predicative noun when it does not denote a class in which the sub-
ject is included, but a concept of equal extension with which it is
declared to be identical‚ as iii. 6 ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας ἡ γλῶσσα
καθίσταται ‘ the tongue is (represents) the unrighteous world.²

The English possessive pronoun is expressed in classical Greek
by the article alone, except for the sake of clearness or emphasis.
So too occasionally in the N.T. ey. Matt. xxvii. 24 ἀπενίψατο
τάς χεῖρας, Luke v. 13 ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα, J ames ii. 15 λειπόμενοι
τῆς ἐφημέρου τροφῆς ‘in lack of their daily food' [01 perhaps
‘ the day's food '], ii. 14 ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ,
μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν ,· ‘can his saith save him?
[But perhaps it is better to take the article simply as referring to
the previous πίστις, ‘can the saith (spoken of) save him' ?]‚ v. 16
ἐξομολογεῖσθε ἀλλήλοις τὰς ἁμαρτίας ‘confess your sins to each
other,’ or perhaps ‘confess 1116 31113 (spoken of in v. 15)ss The·
latter however seems here less appropriate, as the sins spoken of in
v. 15 were those of 1116 sick man alone.

Generally however in the N.T. the genitive of the demonstrative
or personal pronoun is added, (3.9. i. 21 τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, ii. 8 τὸν πλη-
σίον σου, 11. 18 τὴν πίστιν σου...τῶν ἔργων μου, iii. 16 τοῖς μέλεσιν
ὑμῶν, 1. 8 ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, 1. 10 τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ...τῇ ταπεινώσει
αὐτοῦ, i. 11 τὸ ἄνθος αὐτοῦ...τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ...ἐν ταῖς
πορείαις αὐτοῦ. Where the genitive of the pronoun belongs to
more than one noun, it may be stated 0111γο1106, eff. iii. 13 δειξάτω
ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς (αὐτοῦ) τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, iv. 9 ὁ γέλως
ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος ,μεταστραφήτω καὶ ἡ χαρὰ (ὑμῶν) εἰς κατήφειαν,
ii. 18 δείξω ἐκ τῶν ἔργων μου τὴν πίστιν (μου).

Occasionally the article is omitted, and the pronoun alone 6111-
ployed, as in i. 26 μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν ἑαυτοῦ ἀλλ’ ἀπατῶν
καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ, ii. 2 εἰς συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν (if we translate ‘into your
synagogue ' instead of ‘into a synagogue,' or ‘ meeting, of yours '), v.
ΞΟ ὁ ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὑτοῦ σώσει ψυχὴν
αὐτοῦ. Τ1113 13 very common in the LXX„ and especially in the·
