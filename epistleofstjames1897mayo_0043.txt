(2) When a certain Mary is described as ‘the mother of J ames '
we naturally assume that the J ames intended is the most celebrated
of the name, viz. the Lord's brother. But we elsewhere find the
same Mary designated as mother of J oses (Mark xv. 47), or more
generally of James and ‹Joses (Matt. xxvii. 56, Mark XV. 40), 50
that no stress can be laid upon this.

(3) It appears then that the Hieronymian theory is as weak 111

attack as it is in defence, and that if the Epiphanian theciy 15 to f

be attacked with any prospect of success, it must be from the
Helvidian side, on the ground that, no less than the Hieronymian‚
it gives an artificial and non-natural rendering of two passages of
Scripture which we have still to consider3 that it weakens the
force of the narrative which we have already considered, telling
how the mother of Jesus came with his brothers to take 111111;
and gives a less natural meaning to the word ‘brother.’ The
two passages yet to be considered are Matt. i. 24, Ἰωσὴφ.. .
παρέλαβεν τὴν «γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως
οὗ ἔτεκεν v56v‚and JJuke ii 7, καὶ ἔτεκεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν
πρωτότοκον. Reading these in connexion with those other pas-
sages which speak of the brothers and sisters of Jesus, it is
hard to believe that the Evangelists meant us to understand, or
indeed that it ever entered their heads that the words could be
understood to mean, any thing else than that these brothers were
sons of the mother and the reputed father of the Lord. It has
been attempted however to prove that we need not take the
passages referred to in their ordinary and natural sense. Thus
Pearson, treating of the phrase ἕως οὗ, tells us that ‘the manner of

the Scripture language produceth no such inference,' as that, from “330

a limit assigned to a negative, we may imply a subsequent affirma-
tive: and he cites the following as instances in his favour. ‘ When
God said to Jacob “ I will not leave thee until I have done that
which I have spoken to thee of” (Gen. xxviii. 15), it followeth not
that, when that was done, the God of Jacob left him. When the
conclusion of Deuteronomy was written it was said of Moses “ No
man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day ’' (Deut. xxxiv, 6), but
it were a weak argument to infer from thence, that the sepulchre
of Moses has been known ever since. When Samuel had delivered
a severe prediction unto Saul, he “came no more to see him unto
the day of his death '' (1 Sam. xv. 35) ; but it were a strange
