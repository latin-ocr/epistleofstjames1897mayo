Π 1-13 SOLIDARITY OF DUTY 209

‘spirit with ourselveS. If then we systematically neglect any one
commandment of God, say, the duty of honouring our parents, it will
not atone for this, though we should be most scrupulous in all other
respects 3 the one wilful neglect proves that we were not actuated by
a right motive in our obedience to the other commandments : it shows
that we were not led by the Spirit of God.

In the 3rd chapter we read ‘ in many things we all offend' the word
(πταίομεν) being the same as that used here, where it is said, that ‘ he
who offends in one point is guilty of all.' How then are any to be
saved? This is explained in v, 13 ‘ mercy triumpheth over judgment,'
which follows closely on the words ‘So speak and so act, as being
about to be tried by the law of liberty.' The law of liberty is at once
more exacting and more merciful than the law of bondage. It is the
former, because it is not satisfied with the outward act: it is the
latter, because, where there is real love of good, and real desire and
effort to do right, God accepts the will for the deed. To bear in mind
therefore that we shall be judged by the law of liberty tends to
produce in us a deeper conviction of sin, at the same time that it frees
us from anxiety, because we believe that God Himself desires that we
may be perfect as He is perfect, and that He will accomplish this
perfectiori in us by the presence of His Holy Spirit in our hearts, if
we are willing to receive it.

Π. 14—26. Paraphrase.

We have seen that heariny is useless without ἀοίνῳ, that tho doing]
which is consisted to external forms of worship is equally useless, since
tho only service which pleases God is that of praetz‘eccl hiviclhess (wid

without worhs, profession without practice, is worthless, as worthless
as (ι mere verbal philanthropy. Even if such α saith iocre real, it

FA1TH.

St. J ames has already told us that trials are sent to test and confirm
-our saith (i. 3), that without saith prayer is of no avail (i. 6, cf. v.
15, 16), that Christianity consists in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
