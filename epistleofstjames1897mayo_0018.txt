PERSONS ΤΟ WHOM THE EPIsTLE Is ADDRESSED AND PLACE FROM WHICH
IT IS WRITTEN

The various Dispersions of Israel, p. cxii. This Epistle was probably addressed
to the Eastern Diaspora, p. cxiv. What may be inferred from the Epistle

CHAPTER VII. PART Ι

ON THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE

The general result os the externa] and internal evidence points to the fifth
decade after Christ as the time of composition, p. cxxi. This date is
confirmed by the absence of any reference to the fall of Jerusalem, or to
the admission of Gentiles into the Church, p. cxxii. The allusions to
Church order and discipline, and the Judaic tone, are in accordance with
an early date, p. cxxiii. On the other hand it was written after a per-
secution, St. 0] ames had attained a position of authority, and the persons
addressed were no longer recent converts, p. cxxv. Grounds on which
it has been ascribed to a later date ; the use of the name ‘ Christ ³ without
the article, condition of the Churches addressed, waning belief in the
Second Coming, p, cxxvii. Examination of Dr. Davidson⁷s argument
proving that it was written by an anonymous Ebionite shortly before the
sall of Jerusalem, p. cxxx, Examination of von Soden's argument
proving that it was written in the time of Domitian, p. cxxxii. Examina-
tion of W. Briickner’s argument proving that it was forged by an Essene
living at Rome after 150 A.D., p. cxxxvii. Examination ofPfieiderer’s argu—
