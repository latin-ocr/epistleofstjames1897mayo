xviii INTRODUOTION

That the term ‘apostle' was not strictly confined to the
Twelve appears from another passage in which James is men-
tioned, 1 Cor. XV. 4-7. Here it is said that Jesus after His
resurrection ‘appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve, then to
above 500 brethren at once, then to James, then to all the
Apostles,' where we should perhaps consider the term to include
the Seventy, according to the view of Irenaeus ancl other early
writers. At any rate there can be no doubt as to St. Paul's
apostleship. Barnabas also is called an apostle (Acts xiV. 4, 14),
probably also Andronicus and Junias (Rom. xvi. 7), and Silvanus
(1 Thess. ii. 6).1

It seems to me that the most natural interpretation of the two
passages just dealt with is that which concedes the name ‘ apostle’
in the wider sense to St. JameS, but makes a distinction between
him and the Twelve. We should infer the same from 1 Cor. ix. 5,
6, ‘have we not a right to take about a wife that is a believer'
(ἀδελφὴν γυναῖκα) ὡς καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι. και οἱ ἀδελφοὶ
τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ Κηφᾶς5 ἢ μόνος ἐτγὼ καὶ Βαρνάβας οὐκ ἔχομεν
ἐξόυσίαν μὴ ὲρνγάζςσθαι ; Here οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι is contrasted
with ἐτγὼ καὶ Βαρυάβαςε and apparently the ‘brethren of the
Lord' and ‘Cephas' are particularized as being those who were
known to make use of the liberty belonging of right to them
all.

If it should be argued that, where the ‘brethren of the Lord'
are distinguished from the Twelve, this may be spoken loosely of
the majority of them, and need not be understood to apply strictly
to each separate brother3 that it is consistent therefore with the
supposition that J ames, for instance, was an Apostle, provided that
Simon and J ude were not Apostles3 the answer is that the theory
derives part of its seeming strength from the coincidence of the
names of three of the brethren of the Lord and three of the Twelve
Apostles But it is impossible to suppose repeated assertions to
be made respecting the brethren of the Lord, which (on this
supposition) are untrue of him who was by far the best known
among them. Lastly it is to be noticed that neither James nor
Jude claims the title of Apostle in his Epistle‚ and that

s es. Jude seems to disclaim the title for himself in ver. 17, μνή-
