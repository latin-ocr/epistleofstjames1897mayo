ΟΝ THE STYLE OF ST. JAMEs ccxxix

St. James employs this strong weightyfrhythni in poetical and
prophetical passages, such as we find chiefly in the lst and 3rd
chapters and the beginning of ch. v. In argumentative or col-
loquial passages, such as we find in Chapters ii. and iv. and the
latter part of chapter v. the rhythm employed is very different,
generally plain and unlaboured, and often crisp, sharp, abrupt,
running much into interrogations, as in ii. 14 τί ὄφελος ἀδελφοί
μου ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν, ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἕχῃ; μὴ δύναται ἡ
πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν ; V. 13 κακοπαθεῖ τις ἐν ὑμῖυ; προσευχέσθω·
εὐθυμεῖ τις,· ψαλλέτω.

If we are asked to characterize in a few words the more general
qualities of St. James’ style, as they impress themselves on the V
attentive reader, perhaps these would be best summed up in the
terms, energy, vivacity, and, as conducive to both, vividness of
representation. By the last I mean that dislike of mere abstrac-
tionS, that delight in throwing everything into picturesque and
dramatic forms, which is so marked a feature in our Epistle. This
is seen partly in the use of metaphorical expressions of which I ;
have spoken above. Thus the thought of an undecided character
calls up the image of some light object tossing on the surface of the
wave; the development of sin in the heart and life takes the form
of the birth and growth of a living creature3 the conviction pro-
duced by the Word is figured by the reflexion of the face in the
mirror and so on. And often the figure becomes more realistic by
the way in which it is introduced, as an actual narrative of a past
event: so in i. 11 of the withering of the fiower, in i. 24 of the
inan looking into the mirror, ‘ he beheld himself, and is gone, and
straightway forgot what manner of man he wass In like manner,
abstract qualities are exhibited in concrete shape. Is it respect
of persons, or an unreal profession of philanthropy which calls for
rebuke? St. James at once dramatizes the scene3 particularizing
the place—the synagogue; the persons—the rich with his fine
clothes and gold ring, the poor in his shabby attire ; the opposite
treatment of the two—the fawning on the rich σὺ κάθου ὧδε
καλῶς, the supercilious neglect of the poor σὺ στῆθι ἐκεῖ ἢ κάθου
ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου. With a similar fine irony he paints the
behaviour of the soi-disant philanthropist, ‘If a brother or sister
be naked and in lack of daily food, and one of you say to them,
Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled, and yet ye give them not
the things needful to the body3 what does it profit 2 ' Even error
