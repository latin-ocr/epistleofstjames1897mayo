κρινόμενος.

μή with participle implgyioig] condition iv, 17 εἰδότι καλὸν ποιεῖν

μή with participle iri suhjmzctive clause depending on ἵνα 1. 4 ἵνα
ἣτε τέλειοι ἐν μηδενὶ λειπόμενοι.

μή with, participle preceded by article ii. 13 ἡ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ
μὴ ποιήσαντι ἔλεος, where the reference is not to a particular
person but to a class, see Winer p. 606.

1. 5 αἰτείτω παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ πᾶσιν καὶ μὴ ὀνειδίζοντος.
Here we might suppose μή to be used with the participle because
the principal verb is imperative, as in Luke iii. 11 ὁ ἔχων δυὸ
χιτῶνας μεταδότω τῷ μὴ ἔχοντι (but this too is better explained
as generic, not huic qm· riori habet, but ei qui riori habeat), ib. xix. 27
τοὺς ἐχθρούς μου τούτους τοὺς μὴ θελήσαντάς με βασιλεῦσαι
ἀνγάνγετε ὦδε (but here too I should rather take it as a clause in
apposition, referring τούτους to a certain type of men, ‘ the fellows
that would not have me reign over them,' not simply ‘ these men
who would not ³) 3 but I think it is better explained as in 2 Cor.
v. 21 τὸν μὴ «γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν eum qui
‘non nosset peccatum pro nobis peccatam feeit, ‘ one whose character-
istic was sinlessness he made sin'3 so here, ‘let him ask of God
whose characteristic it is to give to all without upbraiding.'

OTHER ADVERBS AND PARTICLES.

c'z'rye interjectional, not found elsewhere in N.T., occurs in the
LXX. and classical authors, see note on iv, 13.

ἀλλ ά. In four passages it has its ordinary force of contrasting
a positive with a negative conception, as in 1. 25 οὐκ ἀκροατὴς...
ἀλλὰ ποιητής, 1. 26, iii. 15, iv. 11. In the remaining passage,
ii. 18 ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις, it appears to have the unusual force of the
Latin immo, adding emphasis to what has been already said3 cf
1 Pet. 111. 14 ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε διὰ δικαιοσύνην, μακάριοι, and
see note in loco.
