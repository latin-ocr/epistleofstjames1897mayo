v 4, 5] NOTEs 153

βοᾷ πρός με ἐκ τῆς γῆς, ih. xviii. 20 (cry of Sodom), Job. xvi. 18 foll.‚
xxxi. 38, Sirac. xxxii. 17 προσευχὴ ταπεινοῦ νεφέλας διῆλθε...καὶ οὗ μὴ
ἀποστῇ ἕως ἐπισκέψηται ὁ ὕψιστος καὶ. . ,ποιήσει κρίσιν. For the oppression
of the hireling cf. Job. vii. 2, ib. xxiv, 6-12, Sirac. xxxiv. 26.

αἱ βοαί] Only here in N.T., cf. EXOd. ii. 23 ἀνέβη ἡ βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς
τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων, 1 Sam. iX. 16 ἐπέβλεψα ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ
λαοῦ μου, ὅτι ἦλθε βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς με’-

εἰς τὰ. ὦτα. Κυρίου Σαβαώθ.] From Isa. V. 9 ἠκούσθη γὰρ εἷς τὰ ὦτα
Κυρίου Σαβαώθ. Τ116 only other passage in N.T. where the form occurs
is Rom. iX. 29, a quotation from Isa. i. 9. In the LXX. it is found in
1 Sam. 1. 3, 11 Ἀδωναῒ Κύριε Ἐλωὶ Σαβαώθ, ib. XV. 2, and in Isa. 11.
12, vi. 3 «Sco. : more often it is translated either by παντοκράτωρ, as in
2 Sam. V. 10, Apoc. iV. 8 compared with Isa. vi. 3, and in Jeremiah
and the Minor Propheta esp. Malachi3 or by δυνάμεων, as in Ps. lix. 5,
lxxx. 7, &c., Hermas Vis. i. 3: sometimes it is omitted in the Greek,
as frequently in Jeremiah. By later writers it is used as an inde-
pendent name of God in the nom. or voc. sing. as in Act. Apoc. T. p.
86, Sibyll. i. 316 ὁ μέγας Σαβαώθ. Its immediate reference is to the
hosts of heaven, whether angels or the stars over which they preside ;
then it is used more generally to express the Divine Omnipotence‚ cf.
Matt. xxvii. 53, Luke vii. 7, 2 Kings vi. 17, Josh. v. 14. See Cheyne's
Isaiah‚ on I. 9. The use of this name is one among many indications
serving to show that the epistle is addressed to Jews. Spitta thinks
there may be a special reference to the angels as ministers of Divine
vengeance, and compares 3 Macc. vi. 17 foll. οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι μέγα εἷς οὐρανὸν
ἀνέκραξαν...τότε ὃ μεγαλόδοξος παντοκράτωρ...ἠνέῳξε τὰς οὐρανίας πύλας,
ἐξ ὧν δύο φοβεροειδεῖς ἄγγελοι κατέβησαν.

εἰσελήλυθαν.] 111 later Greek the regular forms of the imperf„ 2nd
aon, ancl perf. were often changed to the type of the lst aer„ as εἶδαν,
ἔπεσαν, ἐλάβοσαν, εὕροσαν, εἴχοσαν, cf. willer, pp. 86-91, and for examples
of the perf. John xvii. 7 ἔγνωκαν, ib. xvii. 6 τετήρηκαν, Lnke ix. 36
ἑώρακαν, Rom. XVi. 7 γέγοναν, Barnabas Vii. 3 πεφανέρωκαν. Meister-
hans (Gr. Act. Inscr. p. 147) cites παρείληφαν from Smyrna 230 B.C.,
ὃιατετέλεκαν, ἐντέτευχαν, ε’ίσχηκαν, πεποίηκαν, all B.C. from Laconia.

5. ἐτρυφήσατε] Only here in N.T. The noun occurs 2 Pet. ii. 13
ἡδονὴν ἡγούμενοι τὴν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τρυφήν, Luke vii. 25. It is used in blame
here, as generally in classical authors: in good sense in Isa. lxvi. 11
ἵνα ἐκθηλάσαντες τρυφήσητε ἀπὸ εἰσόδου δόξης αὐτῆς ancl Neh. ix. 25.
Hermas joins it with σπαταλάω in Sim. 6. 1 (no doubt a reminiscence of
this passage) τὰ πρόβατα ὡσεὶ τρυφῶντα ἦν καὶ λίαν σπαταλῶντα, Which is
interpreted of those who have given themselves up to the lusts of the
world and are afterwards delivered over to the angel of vengeance.

ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.] 111 contrast to the judgment in heaven of the Lord of
Sabaoth, cf. Matt. Vi. 19 μὴ θησαυρίζετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.

ἐσπαταλήσατε] Found elsewhere in N.T. only in 1 Tim. v. 6 ἡ δὲ
σπαταλῶσα ζῶσα τέθνηκεν. 113 occurs also in Ezek. xvi. 49 ἐσπατάλων
αὕτη καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες, Sir. xxi. 15 ἤκουσεν ὁ σπαταλῶν, Earn. X. 3 ὅταν
σπαταλῶσιν λανθάνονται τοῦ Κυρίου, Clem. Al. Paed. ii. 186 προσεπι-
θρύπτονται σπαταλῶσαι, δέν. iii. 7, 59, but is much rarer than τρυφάω
