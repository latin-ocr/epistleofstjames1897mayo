ταπεινὴ καὶ ἀκατάστατος (⁶ bossed with tempest‚’ A.V. and R.V.); Herm.
sslcmd. 2 ἀκατάστατον δαιμόνιον; it is used by Classical writers, eg.
Deru. F.L. 383 ὃ μὲν δῆμός ἐστιν ἀσταθμητότατον πρᾶγμα τῶν πάντων καὶ

chmd. 5. 2. 7 ἀκαταστατεῖ ἐν πάσῃ πράξει αὐτοῦ, id. Sim. 6. 3. 5 ἀκατα-
στατοῦντες ταῖς βουλαῖς...λέγουσιν ἑαυτοὺς μὴ εὐοδοῦσθαι ἐν ταῖς πράξε-

ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς.] ‘ In the whole course of his life ' : cf. below V.
20, Rom. iii. 16. It is a Hebraism for ἐν πᾶσι 01· ἅπαντα. The same
comparison of life to a journey is implied in the words πορεύομαι, περι-
πατεῖν ; 366 Vorst Hebr. p. 194 foll. ·

9- Καυχάσθω] Repeats the note of πᾶσαν χαράν ver. 2 : it stands first
in order to emphasize the opposition to διψυχία. Far from being thus
undecided and unsettled‚ the Christian should exult in his profession.
If in low estate, he should glory in the chnrch, where all are brothers
and there is no respect of persons3 he should realize his own dignity as
a member of Christ, a child of God, an heir of heaven: if rich, he
should cease to pride himself on wealth or rank, and rejoice that he
has learnt the em ptiness of all worldly distinctions and been taught that
they are only valuable when they are regarded as a trust to be used
for the service of God and good of man. (Af. Sirac. 10. 21 πλούσιος καὶ
ἔνδοξος καὶ πτωχός, τὸ καύχημα αὐτῶν φόβος Κυρίου, Jer. ix. 23 μὴ
καυχάσθω ὁ σοφὸς ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὖτοῦ...καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὃ πλούσιος ἐν τῷ
πλούτῳ αὐτοῦ, ‘but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he under-
standeth and knoweth me...saith the Lord‚' Philo Jos. M. 2. 61 ταπει-
νὸς εἶ ταῖς τύχαις,· ἀλλὰ τὸ φρόνημα μὴ καταπιπτέτω. πάντα σοι κατὰ νοῦν
χωρεῖ; μεταβολὴν εὐλαβοῦ, Rom. i. 16, 1 Pet. iV. 16, 1 Cor. vii. 22 ὃ ἐν
Κυρίῳ κληθεὶς δοῦλος, ἀπελεύθερος Κυρίου ἐστίν· ὁμοίως καὶ ὃ ἐλεύθερος κλη-
θεὶς, δοῦλός ἐστι Χριστοῦ, ib. vii. 29, Phil. iV. 12 οἶδα ταπεινοῦσθαι, οἶδα
καὶ περισσεύειν· ἐν παντὶ καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν μεμύημαι καὶ χορτάζεσθαι καὶ πεινᾶν,
καὶ περισσεύειν καὶ ὑστερεῖσθαι, also a Saying of Hillel quoted in Vajjik
R. (Edersheim Ι. p. 532) ‘My humility is my greatness and my
greatness is my humilissyff The word καυχ. 13 much used by St.
Paul, generally in a good sense : the Christian⁷s boast is in God (Rom.
v, 11), 111 Christ ( Dtom. XV. 17, 1 Cor. i. 31, 2 Cor. X. 17, Gal. vi. 14,
Phil. iii. 3 καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες), in the
hope of salvation (Rom. V. 2) : St. Paul glories in his converts (2 Cor.
vii. 14, ix. 2, 3, 2 Thess. i. 4, Phil. ii. 16), in afflictions (Rom. v. 3),
