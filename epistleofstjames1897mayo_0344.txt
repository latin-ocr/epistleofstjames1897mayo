ness of the flesh and spirit). Strictly speaking the word ῥύπος is used
of the wax of the ear, as in Hippocrates and Clem. Al. Paed. ii. p. 222
P. quoted by Heisen, who suggests that there may be an allusion to
the purged ear, aurium removendae sordes sunt quae audiendi celeritatem
impedire queunt ,· but it cannot be assumed without evidence that the
derivative retained the original force of the simple word. The phrase
σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου is used of baptism in 1 Pet. iii. 21 ; and so Schegg
would explain here3 but there is no reference here to a past event.
The aorist participle is part and parcel of the command contained in
the imperative δέξασθε, as in the quotations from St. Paul. Other
examples of the metaphorical use are Philo M. l. p. 597 (through
repentance the soul washes away) τὰ καταῤῥυπαίνοντα, ι’ὂ.-585, 273,
Dion. Hal. A.R. Xi. 5 ῥυπαίνοντες αἰσχρῷ βίῳ τὰς ἑαυτῶν τε καὶ τῶν
προγόνων ἀρετάς, Epict. Dis-s. 2. 5 recommends the expulsion of a
ῥυπαρὰ φαντασία by one Which is καλὴ καὶ γενναία, Luc. Γ. Auel. 3 καθαρὰν

’πίστιν θεοῦ ἐν κακῇ διδασκαλίᾳ φθείρῃ...ῥυπαρὸς γινόμενος εἷς τὸ πῦρ τὸ
ἄσβεστον χωρήσει. Plutarch uses ῥυπαρία (like our ‘shabbiness’) of
avarice (Illor. p. 60 D) z the compounds ῥυπαρόψυχος, ῥυπαρογνώμων are
found in Byzantine writers. Its precise force in our text will be con-
sidered in the following note.

περισσείαν uaniora] ‘ Overflowing (ebullition) of malice.’ The meaning
is best shown in the cognate phrase in Luke vi. 45 (‘ the evil man out
of the evil treasure in his heart bringeth forth that which is evil ’) ἐκ
γὰρ τοῦ περισσεύματος τῆς καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ. The only other
passages in which περισσεία occurs in N.T. are Rom. v. 17 τὴν περισσείαν
τῆς χάριτος ‘the superabundance of grace‚' 2 Cor. viii. 2 ἡ περισσεία τῆς
χαρᾶς. ..ἐπερίσσευσεν εἷς τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν ‘the overfiowing
of their joy overflowed to (so as to make up) the wealth of their
generosity‚’ 2 Cor. x. 15 εἰς περισσείαν ‘to overflowing' (abundantly).
The writer warns his readers against hasty and passionate words,
against the outbreak of evil temper. We may compare ζύμη κακίας in
1 Cor. v. 8, and the phrase ἀποτίθεσθαι τὰ πέριττα τῆς ψυχῆς quoted from
Plut. Mor. p. 42 B in the n. on ἐσόπτρῳ ver. 23. Then comes the
question whether ῥυπαρίαν is to be taken separately fflalvin, Bouman,
Lange), or as governing κακίας along with περισσείαν. The fact that
’πᾶσαν is not repeated is in favour of the latter construction, which is
supported by Matthaei's Sclcol. τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τὴν ῥυπαίνουσαν τὸν ἄνθρωπον
φησί, τὴν ὡς περιττὴν οὖσαν ἐν ἡμῖν. Perhaps however it is better to
give καί an epexegetic force, ‘all defilement and effervescence of malice'
being equivalent to ‘ all defilement caused by the overflowing malice of
the heart' : so Wiesinger ‘ allen Schmutz der reichlich bei ihnen sich
findenden Bosheit.' Other explanations of περισσεία are (1) ‘superfluity'
A.V. (malitiam mccjorem quam in Christianis empectaveriffi Theile).
This would seem to make the writer guilty of the absurdity of
supposing a certain amount of malice to be proper for a Christian.
It might be said the same objection applies to the rendering
abundantia ‘ overflowing '‚ because it is the seat of the disease
