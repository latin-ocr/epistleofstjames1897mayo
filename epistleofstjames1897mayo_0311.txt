Ι 1, 2] NOTEs 31

cited in 1 Maec. x. is, 25. In 2 Mace. ix. 19 we find the above forms
of salutation combined, τοῖς χρηστοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς πολίταις πολλὰ
χαίρειν καὶ ὑγιαίνειν καὶ εὖ πράττειν βασιλεὺς καὶ στρατηγὸς Ἀντίοχος.
Τ116 ancient Hebrew salutation was ‘ Peaee ' (which the Peshitto gives
here), as in Gen. xliii. 23, and (epistolary) in Ezra iv. 17, v. 7. 111
2 Maec. i. 1 we have the Greek and Hebrew joined, χαίρειν, καὶ εἰρήνην
ἀγαθήν. Α6 a spoken salutation we have examples of εἰρήνη 111 Luke
x. 5, xxiv. 36 (cf. Jas. ii. 16) ; the epistolary use is found in 3 John
15 εἰρήνη σοι, 1 Pet. v. 14. In the other epistles these simple greetings
are further developed‚ as χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (Rom. i. 7, 1 Cor. i. 3, 2 Cor.
i. 2, Gal. i. 3, Eph. i. 2, Phil. 1. 2, Col. i. 2, 1 and 2 Thess, Philemon 3,
Apoc. i. 4, 1 Pet. i. 2, 2 Pet. i. 2); 111 the pastoral epistles and in
2 John we have the fuller form χάρις ἔλεος εῖρήνη; Jude has ἕλεος καὶ
εἰρήνη καὶ ἀγάπη. There is no preliminary salutation in Hebrews,
1 John, 3 John. We meet with the final salutation ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου
Ἰ. X. μεθ’ ὑμῶν 111 many of the epistles. Another final salutation is
ἕῤῥωσθεεῖιῆῢ. valete (Acts XV. 29) ; see Heisen Nov. Hyp. pp. 95-144,
The use of the form χαίρειν naturally suggests the identity of the
writer of this epistle with the writer of the circular in the Acts, and
is at any rate a strong argument against the view that our epistle was
written towards the close of the first century. Is it conceivable that,
after the introduction of the fuller Christian salutation, any one pro-
fessing to write in the name of the most honoured member of the
ehurch at Jerusalem would have fallen back on the comparatively
cold and formal χαίρεινΖ
2. arelo-av] This does not mean strictly totality of joy, as though there
were no joy besides, but merely denotes a superior degree to μεγάλην
01· πολλήν. Possibly the expression originated in an attraction from
πᾶν εἶναι χαράν, and is thus equivalent to ‘entire, unmixed joy.' Of.
Phil. ii. 29 μετὰ πάσης χαρᾶς. 1 Pet. ii. 18 ἐν παντὶ φόβῳ, 1 Tim. ii. 2 ἐν
πάσῃ εὐσεβείᾳ, ὦ. ii. 11 ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ, Tit. ii. 10, 15, iii. 2, Acts XVii.
11 ἐδέξαντο τὸν λόγον μετὰ πάσης προθυμίας, ib. XXiii. ]. πάσῃ συνειδήσει
ἀγαθῇ. The same use is found in classical authors, eg. Soph. lessl.
618 ὦ πῦρ σὺ καὶ πᾶν δεῖμα, ib. El. 293, Eur. Med. 453 πᾶν κέρδος ἡγοῦ

ACD. ii. 56 omnis· οφ do, where other instances aie quoted 1n my note. The
languageis m01e mewsured 1n 1 Pet i. 6, and Heb. xii. 11, πᾶσα μὲν παιδεία
πρὸς μὲν τὸ παρὸν οὗ δοκεῖ χαρᾶς ειι αι ἀλλὰ λ1πης, ὕστερον Ι,δὲ καρπὸν εἰρηνικὸν
τοῖς δι αυτῆς γεγυμιασμενοις ἁποδιδωσιν δικαιοσυνης. But neithel does
St. James say that trial vs all Joy· , 116 bids us count, it joy, that 16, look
at it from the bright side, as capable of being turned to our highest
good.
χαρὰν ἡγήσασθε] The word χαρά 6011066 the preceding χαίρειν
according to the wont of the writer. See ὕπομονή, τέλειον, λειπόμενοι
just below, and the Essay 011 Grammar and Style. Χαρά 16 here ground
of rejoicing, as in Luke ii. 10. The salutation might sound like a
moekery to those who were suffering under various trials, but St.. J ames
proceeds to show that these very trials are a ground for joy. For the
same realization of what was often a mere phrase of courtesy cf. Eur.
