THE AUTHOR xxxix

So when many of the rulers believed, there was ιι disturbance amongr the Jews
and the Scribes and the Pharisees, saying that there was :i danger that all the
people would look to Jesus as the Christ. They came together therefore and
said to J ames ‘ We pray thee restrain the people, sor they have gone astray 111
regard to J esus thinking him to be the Christ. We pray thee 1011015110110011111111
have come to the passover about Jesus. For we all listen to thee. For wc and
all the people bear witness that thou art just, and hast no respect of persons.
Do thou therefore stand on the pinnaclc of the temple, so that thon maycst
be conspicuous and thy words may be well heard by all the people, and
persuade them not to go astray about ,J esus. For all the tribes have come
together with the Gentiles also on account of the Passover) Then the fore-
mentioned Scribes and Pharisees set J ames 011 the pinnacle of the temple and
cried to him ‘O thou just one to whom we are all bound to lis-ten, since
the people are going astray after Jesus who was crucified, tell 115 what is
the door of J esus.⁷ And he answered with a loud voice ‘thy do you ask 1110
concerning J esus the Son of Man? He is both seated in Heaven 00 the right
hand of Power, and will come on the clouds of heaven.’ And when many
were convinced and gave glory at the witness of J ames, and cried ζ Hosanna to
the Son of David,' the same Scribes and Pharisees said to each other ‘We
have done 111 in bringing forward such a testimony to J esus, but let us go up
and cast him down that they may sear to believe him.⁷ And they cried out
saying ί011, oh, even the just has gone astray' and they fultilled that which is
written in Isaiah ‘Let us take away the just, for he is not for our purpose3
wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their deeds.' 80 they went up and they
cast down James the Just, and said to one another ‘let 115 stone J ames the
J ust.' And they began to stone him, since he was not killed by the fall ; but
he turned round and knelt down saying ‘ O Lord God my Father, 1 beseech
thee, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' While they were thus
stoning him one of the priests 01 the sons of Rechab, of whom Jeremiah the
prophet testifics, cried out ‘ Stop ! What do ye 2 The ‚Just is 011111110- for you.'
And one of them who wasa fuller sinete the head of the Just one with 1115

his pillar still remains by the side of the Temple <with the 10501111110111,1 ‘He

And immediately Vespasian commenced the siege.

The brief account given by Josephus (Ant. Jnd. xx. 9. 1) of the
«death of J ames exhibits some important divergences from that of

Hegesippus.

During the interval between the death of Festus (probably in the year 62 account οἱ
A.D.)and the arrival of his successor Albinus, the high priest Ananus the ¹¹]foffgffffissy
younger, being of rash and daring spirit and inclined like the Sadducees in “ 1
general to extreme severity in punishing, brought to trial J ames, the brother
of J esus who is called the Christ, and some others before the court of the
Sanhedrin, and having charged them with breaking· the laws, delivered them
over to be stoned. Josephus adds that the better class of citizens and
