xxxviii INTRODUCTION

It will be seen from the note that there are other versions of the
story, and that in these the vow is said to have been made after
the death of Christ. It is easy to see how a confusion might have
arisen if 5 ames, whether having heard from others or himself
having witnessed the events of the Last Supper, had shaped his
vow after the Lord's own words ‘ I will not drink henceforth of the
fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.' There is, I ’
think, a ring of genuineness about the narrative. Whereas we
usually find in the Apocryphal Gospels some real incident of our
Lord's life smothered in a parasitic growth of puerilities and
trivialities, here there is an originality and simplicity which is not
unworthy of the genuine Gospels themselves.

{3532ssOE I pass on now to Hegesippus, who is quoted to the following

effect in Euseb. HE. ii. 23 ;

The charge of the Church then (after the Α5001151011) devolved on J ames the
brother of the Lord' 111 concert with the Apostles. Ηο 15 distinguished from the
others of the same 1111110 by the title ⁶ 51151 (righteous> w hich has been applied to
him from the first. He was holy from his mother’ 5 1101111)(11·01111 no wine or
strong drink, nor ate animal f;ood no razor came on his head nor did 110
anoint himself with 011, 01· 1150 1110 bath. To 111111 alone was it permitted to
enter into the Holy Place, for he wore no 1170011011, but only linen. And alone
he would go into the temple, where he used to be found on his knees‚ asking
forgiveness for the people, so that his knees became hard like a camel's because
he was ever upon them worshipping God and asking forgiveness for the
people. Accordingly through his exceeding righteousness he was called
righteous (‘ 511517) and ‘Oblias ' which being interpreted is ‘the defence of the
people' and ‘righteousness,’ as the prophets declared of him.1 Some of the
seven sects, which Ι have mentioned, inquired of him, ‘What 15 1110 (1001 of
505115 (τίς ἡ θύρα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ) 2² 2 And he said that he was the Saviour, where—
upon some believed that 5 05115 15 1110 Christ. Now the forementioned sects did
1101 believe in the resurrection or in the coming of one to recompense each man
according to his works. But as many as did believe, believed through J ames.

the pseudo—Abdias (Hz'sc. Aposc. vi. 1), who refers to Hegesippus as his authority sor
part of his account of James, says that he was son of Joseph by a former wife, and
so full of love to Jesus ut crucifixo eo eibum capere noluerit, priusquam α mortuis
resumentem videret, quod meminerat sibi εί fratribus α olm-isto ayeozte m vivis fuisse
praedictum. Quare ei primum omnium, ut et Mariae Maydalemw ct Petro apparere

«Iacobum invitavit. Similarly in the thirteenth century J ac. de Voragine (chend. Aur.
lxvii.): In Parasceue aiacem mortuo Domino, sicat dicit Joseplms et Hieronymus in
libro Dc V iris Illuscrihus, <Iacobus vetlem vovit, δια, mixing up in what follows the
accounts of Jerome and Gregory. Mr. Nieholson thinks that ,Iosephus here stands '
for Hegesippus, the names being often interchanged, and that the latter may be
the original authority for the particulam in which the later writers differ from
5 evome.

1 Probably a reference to the verse cited below, Isa. iii. 10 (LXX. version).

² Mosheim, quoted in Routh, Rez. Scwr. i. 237, suggests that ε505115’ 11010 15 a
inisreading of the original Araniaic word (Jcschua) denoting ‘ Salvation.²
