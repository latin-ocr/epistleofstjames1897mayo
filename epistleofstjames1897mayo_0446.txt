166 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

followers of Heracleon and the Ohurch of Rome in later times, sup-
posed it to retain a purely spiritual efficacy, thus changing a hypo-
thetical appendage to the injunction (κᾶν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς) into the
essence of the injunction itself. There is, I believe, no recorded
instance during the first eight centuries of the anointing of the sick
being deferred, as having only a spiritual efficacy, to the point of
death, except among the Heracleonites‚ whose conception of the use
of the anointing, as described by Epiphanius l.c., is almost in verbal
agreement with the language of a monastic rule for Extreme Unction
contained in Martene (De Antiquis Ecclesiae leuibus, vol. 5 p. 241)
ut more mimis uncti praeparatus acl certamen aereas possit superare
potestates.

Many stories are told of cures wrought by the Unction for the Sick
in D. of Christian Aut. pp. 1455 and 2004. In the Greek Ohurch the
oil, called εὐχέλαιον, is usually consecrated by seven priests. In the
NVest we find the oil consecrated by laymen and even by women as late
as the Gth century. In the Sth century Boniface ordered all pres-
byters to obtain the oi] 01 the sick from the bishop. It is curious that
in the early church it was not necessary for the anointing to be
done by a priest: it was frequently performed by the sick man
or by his friends.1 It is not till A.D. 852 that the function of
anointing is confined to the priest. The original intention for the
healing 01 the body was forgotten and ‘ the rite came to be regarded
as part 01 a Christian’s immediate preparation for death. Hence in
the l2th century it acquired the name 01 unctio extrema. . . . In the 13th
century it was placed by schoolmen among the seven rites to which
they then limited the application of the term sacrament) D. of C. A.

The effect 01 this sacrament is thus defined by the Council 01 Trent
(sessio decima quarta). After declaring (capul) that it was ordained
by Christ (Mark vi. 13) and promulgated in this verse by St. James,
the decrce continues (cap 2) res et effectus liujus sacramenti illis
verbis explicatur: Et oratio fidei salvabit infirmum et alleviabit eum
Dominus ,· et si in peccatis sit, dimittentur ei. Res etenim liaec est qratia
Spiritus sancti, cujus cht'io delicta, si quae sint adhuc expianda, ac
peccati reliquias absteryit et aeqroti (mimam alleviat et coufirmat...et
sanitatem corporis interdum, ubi saluti animae expedierit, consequitur.
The dogma is clenched by the following anathemas: Can. I. Si quis
dixerit extremam Unctionem uon esse vere et proprie Sacramentum a
Christo Domino nostro institutum et a beato Jacobo Apostolo promul-
9atum, sed ritum tautum acceptum a patribus aut flymeutum humanum ,-
anatliema sit. Gan. II. Si quis dixerit sacram infirmorum Urzctioriem
uon conferre qratiam uec renu'ttere peccata uec alleviare iv firmos, secl jam
cessasse, quasi olim sumit qratia curationum ‚· anatliema sit. Similarly
in Canons ΙΙΙ. and IV. those are anathematized who think that the
Roman rite is opposed to the teaching 01 St. J ames and may be safely
neglected by Christians‚ as well as those who think that the Elders
mentioned by St. James are other than episcopally ordained priests.

¹ Caesarius of Arles (502 A.D.) during an epidemic recommends a person to anoint
both himself and family with blessed oi] (Scrm. 89. 5).
