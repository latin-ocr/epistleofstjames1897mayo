94 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

Pollux as τὸ εἷς τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν μὴ μένον, cf. Herod. i. 32 οὗ γάρ τοι ὅ μέγα
πλούσιος μᾶλλον τοῦ ἐπ’ ἡμέρην ἔχοντος ὀλβιώτερός ἐστι.

16, τις ἐξ filiam] Tit. i. 13 εἶπέ τις ἐξ αὐτῶν, and frequently. Sometimes
τις is omitted both in the accusative as Matt. xxiii. 34 ἀποστέλλω
προφήτας...καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀποκτενεῖτε, and in the nominative as John xvi.
17 εἶπον ἐκ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ.

ὑπάγετε ἑν εἰρήνῃ.] Of. the words of the jailor at Philippi to Paul
πορεύεσθε ἐν εἰρήνῃ Acts xvi. 36, Jud. xviii. 63 but more commonly we
find εἷς used, implying a future result, as in Mark 17. 34 with ὕπαγε,
Luke vii. 50 with πορεύου, also ch. viii. 48, l Sam. i. 17, xx. 42, with
βάδιζε 2 Sam XV. 9, ἀπελύθησαν μετ’ εἰρήνης Acts XV. 33. In Tobit xii.
5 we have ὕπαγε ὑγιαίνων in much the same sense. It is a formula of
comfort (‘ be at ease‚⁷ ‘have 110 anxiety ⁷) usually grounded upon some
*act or assurance, as ], Sam. xx, 42 the oath of friendship between David
and Jonathan, Acts xvi. 36 the order of the magistrates. Here it
should have been followed or preceded by the gift of food and clothing
instead of the mocking words.

θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε] BeySChlag and others take these verbs in
the middle sense ‘ warm yourselves and seed yourselves.’ The Revisers
retain the old version ‘be ye warmed and fed‚' which certainly gives a
better sense and one inore suited to the caustic irony of Which St.
James is a master. The sight of distress is unpleasant to these dainty
Christiane. They bustle out the wretched-looking brother or sister
with seeming kindness and what sounds like an order to others to
provide for their immediate relies, but without taking any step to carry
out the order. Compare Hor. 2 Sat. 8. 25 tibi cli quaecunque preceris
commoda (lent. To have said directly ‘go and get warin, go and eat,'
would have been giving an order which it was plainly not in their own
power to obey: the other mode of address (like the barren fig—tree)
excites a momentary delusive hope analogous to the impression pro-
duced by saith without deeds. It could only be rightly used where
miraculous power accompanicd the word, as in Mark v. 34 ὕπαγε εἰς
εἰρήνην καὶ ἴσθι ὑγιὴς ἀπὸ τῆς μάστιγός σου. Otherwise it is only a
specimen of that hypocrisy oi* saying without doing (λέγῃ ἔχειν Ver. 14)
which called forth the severest reproof of St. J ames as of 1113 Master.
The active of θερμ. 13 common in classical writers and is found once 111
LXX. (Sirac. 38. 17) θέρμανον κοπετόν, ‘make hot the wailing‚' never in
N.T.: θερμαίνεσθαι occurs elsewhere in N.T. only in Mark xiv, 54, 67,
John xviii. 18, 25 of Peter wal-ming himself at the fire: in LXX. we
find it with passive sense Hos. vii. 7 ἐθερμάνθησαν ὡς κλίβανος and in
Hagg. i. 6 used, as here, with reference to clothi11g‚ ἐφάγετε καὶ οὐκ εἷς
πλησμονήν..,περιεβάλεσθε καὶ οὐκ ἐθερμάνθητε (Where ib must mean, not
‘ did not warm yourselves‚’ but ‘ were not warmed ²), so Job xxxi. 20
ἀπὸ κουρᾶς ἀμνῶν μου ἐθερμάνθησαν οἶ ὦμοι αὐτῶν, l Kings i. 1 (of David)
περιέβαλλον αὐτὸν ἱματίοις καὶ οὐκ ἐθερμαίνετο, tropically Psa. xxxviii. 3
ἐθερμάνθη ἡ καρδία μου (‘ my beart was heabed’) καὶ ἐν τῇ μελέτῃ μου
ἐκκαυθήσεται πῦρ. The passive is also common in classical writers, as
Eur. El. 402 χαρᾷ θερμαινόμεσθα καρδίαν. There iS just as little objection to
taking χορτάζεσθαι as passive. The noun χόρτος ‘fodder‚' on which see
