212 COMMENT

of St. J ames on their side, when he speaks of the profession of a right
saith being consistent with devilish wickedness. Nor can we evade
this by assuming that the profession is merely verbal. In the
supposed case there is real belief, a belief, be it observed, which has a
real effect on the believer 3 but the effect is not that which St. James'
opponents claimed for their orthodox faith 3 not an assurance of a salva-
tion, but the extremity of terror. There can, however, be no doubt of
what St. J ames himself really held in regard to the connexion between
thought and action. He spoke in i. 19 of the seminal power of the
divine Word received into the mind: he is equally explicit below as to
the evil influence of words uttered at the instigation of a wisdom which
is earthly, sensual and devilish (iii. 6, 15). But, as is explained in the
Parable of the Sower, there are many things which may hinder the
word, or the thought, or the doctrine, from producing its natural
effect. It may lie altogether on the outside of the mind 3 it may
make a mere momentary impression3 it may form strange combina-
tion with the already existing growths ; as, for instance, the thought
of One All-powerful and All-holy, meeting with a will which is
obstinately set on evil, is naturally productive of terror. It is only
where it finds a good soil, clear of weeds, that the full virtue of the
Word is manifested. We need not however assume that the Word is
necessarily wasted, where its effect is not immediately perceptible. The
use of short formularies, texts or hymns committed to memory, is to
store up for the future truths to which the heart may be inaccessible
at the moment.

Ι have in the introduction (pp. lxxxvii. foll) touched on the relation
which St. Paul’s teaching on the subject of faith bears to that of St.
J ames. We saw there that there was substantial agreement between
them, notwithstanding the verbal contradictions which may be found
in their Epistles. Both agree that ‘in many things we offend all‚’
that man is saved not by his own merits‚ but by the goodness and mercy
of God. What differences there are may be explained partly by the
difference of the errors which they controvert. St. Paul is arguing
against a dependence on the scrupulous performance of the Jewish
law (what he calls the ἔργα νόμου), and against the denial of salva-
tion to the Gentiles unless they conl’ormed in all points to that
law. St. J ames is arguing against a dependence upon Jewish
orthodoxy, irrespective of moral conduct (what St. Paul might call
ἔργα πίστεως or ‘saith working by love '). But partly the difference is
due to the difference in the character and development of the two men.
To the one, whose spiritual experience had been broken by a violent
shock, and whose special office it was to open the kingdom of heaven
to the Gentiles, the Gospel is the antithesis of the Law 3 to the other,
who had been brought up with J esus, who had known his disciples from
the first, and whose special office it was to make the final offer of
salvation to his own countrymen‚ the Gospel was the consummation of
the Law. Again‚ the one with his dee ply speculative nature loves to fix his
gaze on the Divine factor in man’s salvation, the other with his strong
practical bent directs his attention mainly to the human factor 3
