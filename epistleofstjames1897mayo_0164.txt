evil. So we are told of a treatise addressed to the Gnostic F lorinus by
Irenaeus, in proof that God was not the author of evil. The reference in iv.
11 to those who ‘judge the laW‚' would apply to the attacks of such Gnostics
as Cerdon and Marcion 011 the O. T. Lastly, the degradation of Paul’s
justifying saith into an unfruitful assent of the intellect was nowhere so likely
to be found as among the Gnostics. To this ultra-Pauline Gnosticism J ames
opposes no Judaizing theology, but the simple rules of practical Christianity
as understood by the Catholic Church. His polemio does not touch Paul’s own
doctrine : Paul would never have given the name of saith to this dead intel-
lectual assent; but it does touch the Gnostics who claimed the authority of
Paul, and J ames fails to distinguish between the two views. This is easily ex-
· plicable from the fact that James himself, like his contemporaries (compare
the Ignatian and the Pastoral Epistles), no longer uses saith in its old sense of
absolute trust, forming the only foundation of Christian piety, but makes it
coordinate with love, patience, obedience, works, &a
The Soteriology of the Epistle approaches so nearly to that of the Gospels,
that it 15 110 wonder some have been tempted to assign it to a very early period.
This however has been shown to be impossible by a comparison with other
Christian writings ; ancl it 15 3150 inconsistent with the absence of all allusion to
the apologetic and eschatological topics which so much occupied the attention
of the early Church. We find here no attempt to prove that J esus was the
Messiah, and that he would shortly return to reveal the promised salvation.
The undogmatic character of the epistle is to be explained, like the dogmatic
simplicity of John, not on the supposition that it was written before Chris-
tianity had become dogmatic, but that dogma was already securely settled.
The Church of Rome, however, with its predominantly practical tendency.
rejected those speculative and mystica] elements of Paulinism, which were
retained and developed by the churclies of Asia Minor. And thus it is that the
Catholicized Paulinism of the second century approaches so nearly to pre-
Christian Hellenism. Monotheism, the Mor-al Law, Future Retribution, these
are the prominent doctrines in both; the only difference being that, in the
former, these doctrines are based upon Revelation and propagated by au

organized institution.

Pfleiderer It will be seen that on severa-l points Pfleiderer recedes from the

abandons . . .
some ofthe ground occupied by 1115 predecessors of the negative school. He

lillssiss‘r'gcies-'f allows that our Epistle could not have been written whilst the
COESOPS' admission of Gentiles into the Church was still a burning ques-
tion : he allows that it is not intended as an answer to the Epistle

to the Romans, and that in fact St. Paul would have assented to

all that is said in it as to the futility of an unfruitful faith. He

does not regard the author as an Ebionite or Essene, or suppose

him to be addressing some small dissenting body: on the contrary,

J ames is a typical Catholic of the latter half of the second century,

and gives expression to the ethical undogmatic Christianity of the

time: further, he is addressing the Church of Rome, which he
rightly assumes to be representative, in its defects‚ of the degeneracy

of the Church at large. Pfleiderer ridicules Schwegler’s identifica-

tion of the rich with Gentile‚ and the poor with J ewish Christians
