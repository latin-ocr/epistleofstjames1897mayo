ΙΙ 10-13] NOTES 91

οὕτως λαλεῖτε καὶ οὕτως ποιεῖτε] Τ110 repetition of οὕτως is in accordance
with the earnest weighty style of the writer: see i. 19 on βραδύς, and
cf. Buttm. p. 341. lt insiste on the iinportance of a right regulation
of speech (on Which see ch. iii. below), as well as of action (on which see
vv. 14—26 of this chapter). The reference in οὕτως is to the following
ὡς, as in 1 Cor. iX. 26 οὕτω πυκτεύω ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων, N). iii. 15 σωθήσεται
οὕτως ὡς διὰ πυρός.

ὡς διὰ. νόμου ἐλευθερίας μέλλοντες κρίνεα-6110] The absence of the article,
which was used in i. 25, serves to give prominence to the qualifying
genitive. For other instances in N. T. of the Classical use of ὡς
with part. cf. 1 Cor. iV. 18, 2 Cor. V. 20, Hel). xiii. 17, and VViner
p. TTOf

13. ἡ γὰρ κρίσις ἀνέλεος τῷ μὴ ’ποιήσαντι ἕλεος] The reading ἀνέλεος is
found in all the best MSS. instead of ἀνίλεως. Neither form occurs else-
where, but we find ἀνελεής (111 scholiasts and Philo M. ii. 53) and 1110
inore Classical ἀνηλεής (Plato and Philo M. ii. 65), ἀνελεήμων (Wisd.
xii. 5, Rom. i. 31). As to the formation, ἀνέλεος is regul-<tr from the
classical ὁ ἕλεος (like ἄλογος, ἄθεος), but τὸ ἕλεος is the form used in
N.T.‚1 from which would regularly be formed ἀνελεής (like εὐγενής from
γένος) or ἀνηλεής (like ἀνηρεφής from ἐρέφω). We have another
reference to κρίσις below V. 12. With ποιεῖν ἔλεος cf. Josh. ii. 12
ὀμόσατέ μοι ὅτι ποιῶ ὑμῖν ἕλεος καὶ ποιήσατε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἕλεος, Mat‘c. Vi. 2
ὅταν ποιῇς ἐλεημοσύνην, ΤΟ13113. Xii. 9 ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται καὶ
αὕτη ἀποκαθαριεῖ πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν· οἶ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ δικαιοσύνας
πλησθήσονται ζωῆς. For the thought cf. Matt. v. 7, vi. 14, vii. 1, xviii.
28-35 the parable of the debtor, XXV. 41-46 the description of 1110
judgment, Tit. iii. 5, below V. 20, Psa. xviii. 25, 26, Prov. xvii. 5.
Simo. xxviii. 2ff ἄφες ἀδίκημα τῷ πλησίον σου καὶ τότε δεηθέντος σου αἶ
ἁμαρτίαι σου λυθήσονται, Tobit. iv. ἰ’-12, Test. xii. Patr. p. 641 ἔχετε
εὐσπλαγχνιάν κατὰ παντὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐν ἐλέει ἵνα καὶ ὅ Κύριος εἷς ὑμᾶς
σπλαγχνισθεὶς ἐλεήσῃ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι καίγε ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων ἡμερῶν ὂ Θεὸς ἀποστέλλει
τὸ σπλάγχνον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς καὶ ὅπου εὓρῇ σπλάγχνα ἐλέους, ἐν αὐτῷ
κατοικεῖ, Sibyll. ii. 224 ῥύεται ἐκ θανάτου ἕλεος, κρίσις ὃππότ1 ἂν ἔλθῃ,
Dem. Mid. 547 οὐδείς ἐστι δίκαιος τυγχάνειν ἐλέου τῶν μηδένα ἐλεούντων.
The reference to mercy looks baekward 101. 27 and forward 10 ver.
15 foll.

κατακαυχᾶται ἕλεος κρίσεως] ‘Mei-cy triumphs over judgment.' The
compound verb is found also below iii. 14 and Rom. xi. 18 ; the simple
verb above i. 9. For the thought see Hosea vi. 6 ἔλεος θέλω ἦ θυσίαν,
quoted in Matt. ix. 13, where the Pharisees complain of J esus eating
with publicans and sinners, and again Mate. xii. 7 when they find fault
with the disciples for eating the ears of 00111, Luke vii. 47, 1 Pet.. iv.
8, Matt. xxiii. 23. The absence ofa connecting particle is a feature in
1110 vigorous style of the writer, cf. below v, 6 κατεδικάσατε, ἐφονεύσατε
τὸν δικαιον· οὒκ ἀντιτάσσεται ὑμῖν, and above i. 19 ταχὺς εἷς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι,
βραδὺς εἷς τὸ λαλῆσαι. Some MSS. insert δέ, as in ver. 15 below,

¹ Similari1istances of change 111 gender in Hellenistic Greek are τὸ πλοῦτος, τὺ
ζῆλος, τὸ σκότος, 011 which see Winer p. 76.
