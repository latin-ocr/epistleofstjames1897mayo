collection to infer, that he therefore gave him a visit after he was
dead. “ Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of
her death'' (2 Sam. vi 23) 3 and yet it were a ridiculous stupidity to
dream of any midwifery in the grave. Christ promised his presence
to the Apostles “until the end of the world ’' (Matt. xxviii. 20) 3
who ever made so unhappy a construction, as to infer't-from thence
that for ever after he would be absent from themfl? ' (C‘rced, p. 174).
Importance It is difficult to believe that a man of Pearson’s ability can have

Ῑξζξὲζζζξέζξ mention of one of which suggests, while the mention of the other

andvsslfficllilmst negatives, the future occurrence of the action spoken of. Jf we

ωξξξξξὲξξοῃ read ‘the debate was adjourned till the papers should be in the

alfiffillfttihse hands of the members‚' it as certainly implies the intention to

debate was adjourned till that day six months,' or ‘ till the Greek
Kalends,' implies the contrary. So when it is said ‘to the day of his
death‚' ‘ to the end of the world,' this is only a more vivid way of say-
ing in saecula saeculorum. In like manner thephrase ‘ unto this day'
implies that a certain state of things continued up to the very last
moment known to the writer: the suggestion is of course that it
will still continue. The remaining instance is that contained in
Gen. xxviii. 15. This is a promise of continued help on the part
of God until a certain end is secured. When that end is secured
God is no further bound by his promise, however much the
patriarch might be justified in looking for further help from his
general knowledge of the character and goodness of God. To take
now a case similar to that in hand : supposing we read ‘Michal had
no child till she left David and became the wife of Phaltiel,' we
should naturally assume that after that she did have a child. So
in Matt. i. 24 the limit is not one beyond which the action becomes
naturally and palpably impossible: on the contrary it is just that
point of time when under ordinary circumstances the action would
become both possible and natural,1 when therefore the reader, with-
