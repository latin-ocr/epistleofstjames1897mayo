in the book 01 1116 law to do thern,’ as proving the absolute obedi-
ence required by the law, Gal. iii. 10, (2) 10 1116 confession of the
Psalmist (xiv. cxliii. 2, 61. Rom. iii. 20, Gal. ii. 16) that ‘by the
works 01 1116 law shall no flesh be justified‚' and 10 that of the
Preacher (vii. 20, cf. Rom. iii. 23) ‘there is not a just man upon
earth that doeth good and sinneth not.' If the contrary suppo-
sition were true; if 81. James wrote after 81. Paul, must he
not, with these passages before him, have either attempted to
meet the arguments, if he dissented; or 11 116 agreed with them
(as 116 certainly does in ii. 10, 11 and in iii. 2), would he not
have avoided the use 01 phrases such as χωρὶς τῶν ἕρνγων, which
were liable to be misunderstood alike by the followers and the
opponents of 1116 Apostle to the Gentiles?

St. Paul goes on 10 argue that the blessings promised 10 Abraham
and all the families of the earth in him, and the covenant made
with Abraham and his seed, are anterior 10 and irrespective of the
law 3 that the Scripture expressly attributes to Abraham a
rigffleousness, not of works, but 01 saith, and states generally
that ‘the just shall live by faith.' To these arguments again
no reference is made by St. James, except to the familiar quo-
tation ἐπίστευσεν Ἀβραὰμ τῷ θεῷ καὶ ἐλονγίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς
δικαιοσύνην (Jamcs ii. 21, 22), which was probably in common
use among the Jews to prove that orthodoxy of doctrine sufficed
101· salvation. Such an application of 1116 text 81. J ames meets by
pointing out that Abraham's saith proved itself by action, when
he offered Isaac on the altar: if he had not acted thus, he would
not have been accounted righteous, or called the Friend 01 God.
It 15 interesting to observe how 81. Paul deals with this statement,
to which he distinctly rcfers in Rom. iv. 2. 81. {lanies had said
Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατήρ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξ ἕρνγων ἐδικαιώθη, 81. Paul replies
εἰ «γὰρ Ἀβαὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα, 10111 11115, as 116
shows, is inconsistent with the phrase ‘ reckoned 101· righteousness‚'
which, like the similar phrase in Ps. xxxii. 1, 2, implies an act of
free grace on the part of God, not a strict legal obligation of
wages earned for work done. His second answei] is to replace the
quotation 111 115 original context (Rom. iv. 16-2‘22), as spoken of
the birth, not 01 1116 sacrifice 01 Isaac. Abraham's saith in the
promised birth was a settled trust in God, a long-continued hoping
against hope: it was this posture of mind, not any immediate
action consequent upon it, which was reckoned to him for
