you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.' Compare
with these verses the universalist tone of St. J ames, his reference
to the Name by which we are called, to the Spirit implanted in
us, the distinctive epithets attached to the royal law of liberty,
the promise of the kingdom to those that love God and are begotten
again through the word of truth to be a kind of firstfruits of His
creatures. Even St. Paul's own Epistles, so far as the earliest
group, consisting of the two addressed to the Thessalonians, is
concerned, do not go much beyond St. James. The main subject
of this group in contrast with the subject of the second group,
consisting of the Epistles to the Corinthians‚ Galatians and
Romans, is defined by Bp. Lightfoot1 to be Christ the J udge,
as opposed to Christ the Redeemer. One topic indeed is absent
from our Epistle, viz., the reference to the Resurrection as proving
that Jesus is the Messiah; but if this is a letter addressed, as it
purports to be, to believers by a believer, there was no reason to
insist on what was already acknowledged by both parties.

So much in answer to the charge that it falls below the standard
of early Christianity. The next thing is to show that it rises
above the standard of contemporary Hebrew writings. Spitta
seems to think that, if, taking the whole range of pre-Christian
J ewish literature, inspired and uninspired, he can here and there
discover a parallel for a precept or a maxim of St. James, this is
enough to prove that the Epistle is itself pre-Christian 3 but surely
this is to forget that the New Testament has its roots in the Old
Testament, and that Christ came not to destroy but to fulfil. The
right course, as it seems to me, is to take an undoubted product of
the first century B.C. and compare it with our Epistle. Ι have
chosen for this purpose the Psalms of Solomon‚ a treatise which is
considered by its latest editors to approach so nearly to Christian
thought and sentiment, that they have hazarded the conjecture
that it might have been written by the author of the Nema Dimittis
included in St. Luke's Gospel. The first difference which strikes
ine is the narrow patriotism of the one, contrasted with the univer-
salism of the other. In the Psalms of Solomon everything centres
in Israel and Jerusalem. The past history of Israel is referred to
as showing that it was under the special protection and govern-
ment of God (ix., xvii.). God punished the sins of Israel in times
past by the captivity in Babylon, He punishes them now by the
