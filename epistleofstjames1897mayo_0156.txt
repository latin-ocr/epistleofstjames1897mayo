the Epistle.

cxxxvi IN TRODUCTION

the Bible and Apocrypha were written for Jews by Jews, as to
deny this of the Epistle of St. J ames.
To go now a little more into detail, Von Soden tells us that

engaif- nothing is said of the Temple, the Worship, the Law. We

have seen that with regard to worship, a most important rule is
laid down, which implies the insignificance of the Mosaic ritual
no less than our Lord’s words ‘neither in this mountain nor
yet at Jerusalem? As to the Temple, one does not quite 500
how it could be introduced in a letter to Jews residing abroad,
unless it were to urge them to send contributions more regularly

or to come up inore :frequently to Jerusalem. But trivial details ⁷

of this sort would be entirely out of place in the exhortations
of one who may be best described as the living einbodiment of
the Sermon on the Mount. As to the Law, how can it be said
to be ignored, when there is a distinct reference to the common
J ewish error, that you might pick and choose your favourite coni-
mandment and confine your attention to that: ‘Whoever offends
in a single point is guilty of the whole law3 for he that said Thou
shalt not commit adultery, said also Thou shalt not kill'? and
when in iv. 11 1110 Law appears as the representative of the Law-
giver and Judge? This conception of the LaW, as the expression
of the mind and will of God, leads at once to its being regarded as
a Law of Liberty, the guiding principle of life, not the mere
written statute. Von Soden asks why St. James does not point
out that such a Law of Liberty was already recognized in the Old
Testament. The answer 15 that it was unnecessary, because the
very phrase would naturally recall to the minds of his Jewish
readers similar expressions in the Old Testament (see note on i. 25),
and would also be felt to be in entire accordance with the ethical
teaching of Christ, as contained in what we know as the Sermon
on the Mount, and probably in the earliest summaries provided for
the use of believers.

Lastly Von Soden asserts that Jewish Ghristians would never

ε’ '1 limit the sense of ἔρνγα 10 ‘works of love’ but would necessarily

include in it St. Paul's ‘works of the law? In the actual
passage in question (ii. 14-26) we need not limit ἔργα 10 works
of love, strictly speaking: the sacrifice of Isaac (ii. 21) could
hardly be described as such. They are ἔργα καλά 111 1110 widest
sense3 though they exhibit no doubt the joint action of saith and
love, if there is any meaning in the illustration from almsgiving
