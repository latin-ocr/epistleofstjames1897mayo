ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GRAMMAR OF ST. JAMEs cxcv

ὅδε, supposed to be used for ὁ δεῖνα, 566 11. on 11-1. 13, εἰς τήνδε
τὴν πόλιν.

αὐτός = Lat. ipse, emphatic, (α) ordinary use i. 12 ὁ Θεὸς ἀπεί-
ραστός ἐστιν, πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα, 11. 6 (οἱ πλούσιοι) αὐτοὶ
ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς; (b) special Hellenistic use ii. 7 οὐκ αὐτοὶ βλασ·
φημοῦσιν, 566 notes on the two verses: (c) the nom. is not used
pleonastically by St. James, as by St. Luke in xxiv. 13, 14 δύο ἐξ
αὐτῶν ἦσαν πορευόμενοι...καὶ αὐτοὶ ὡμίλουν πρὸς ἀλλήλους.

ὁ αὐτός 111. 10 ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ στόματος, ver. 11 ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς
ὀπῆς. St. James does not use αὐτὸς ὁ 111 131115 561156, as St. Luke
does in the phrase αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρα (1113. ‘at the very hour'), which
occurs in ii. 38, vii. 21, Acts xvi. 18 and elsewhere.

αὐτός = Lat. is, unemphatic in the oblique cases 3 but gaining a
certain emphasis by repetition, as in iii. 9 ἐν αὐτῇ εὐλογοῦμεν καὶ
ἐν αὐτῇ καταρώμεθαε or by position, as in St. Luke xxiv. 24 αὐτὸν
δὲ οὐκ εἶδον, ver. 31 αὐτῶν δὲ διηνοίχθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί. It is also
used pleonastically, 11013 only in the genitive with the article, as
in the cases mentioned above3 but When occurring in apposition
to the noun, or participle equivalent to noun, as in iv. 17 εἰδότι
καὶ μὴ ποιοῦντι ἁμαρτία αὐτῷ ἐστιν.

αὐτοῦ instead of ἑαυτοῦ,1 111 i. 18 ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς
ἀπαρχὴν τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων (AOP have ἑαυτοῦ); 1. 26 Tregelles
and Tischendorf read (With Sin, AKL διο.) μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσ-
σαν αὐτοῦ ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, where I have followed
WH. in reading (with B÷) ἑαυτοῦ. 866 also note on v. 20, where
some of the latest editors read ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ.

ἑαυτοῦ 15 used for σεαυτοῦ 111 i. 22 γίνεσθε ποιηταὶ καὶ μὴ
ἀκροαταὶ μόνον παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς, 11. 4 διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυ-
τοῖς. We find however σεαυτόν 111 11. 8.

The use of the article with the demonstrative pronoun is the
same as in classica] Writers, cf. i. 7 ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος, iii. 15 αὕτη
ἡ σοφία, iv. 13 τήνδε τὴν πόλιν.

Relative.

Attracted ii. 5 κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας ἧς ἐπηγγείλατο.
Indefinite (with ἐάν for ἂν) iv. 4 ὃς ἐὰν βουληθῇ φίλος εἶναι
τοῦ κόσμου; 11. 10 ὅστις ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ, iv. 13 (οἱ λέγον-
