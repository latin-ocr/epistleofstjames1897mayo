V 7-10] NOTEs 157

ὑετὸς ἡμῖν πρώϊμος καὶ ὅψιμος (perhaps referred to here), J er. v. 24, J oel
ii. 23, Zech. X. 1. The former rain comes after the sowing, the latter
just before the ripening, see D. ofB. under ‘ rain.' For the ellipsis of
ὑετός see Winer p. 738 foll. and above 111. 11 τὸ γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ πικρόν.

8, στηρίξατε τὰς καρδίας.] So Apoc. 111. 2 στήρισον τὰ λοιπὰ ἃ μέλλει
ἀποθανεῖν, LUkO XXfi· 32 στήρισον τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου. This strength-
ening iS more usually ascribed to the Divine working, as in 1 Thess,
iii, 13 εἷς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμῶν τὰς καρδίας, 1 Pet. V. 10, 2 Thess. 11. 17,
Ps. li. 12. It is the true cure for διψυχία. The noun στηριγμός occurs
in the same sense 2 Pet. iii. 17. As in παίζω and σαλπίζω, the in-
flexions vary between o· and ξ (Winer p. 110).

ἤγγικεν,] 1 Peb. iv. 7 πάντων τὸ τέλος ἤγγικεν· σωφρονήσατε οὖν, Matt.
iii. 2 and often ἤγγικεν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν, Luke xxi. 28, Heb. X. 25,
Phil. iv. 6 ὁ Κύριος ἐγγύς· μὴ μεριμνᾶτε, 1 Cor. xvi. 22, Barn. xxi. 3
ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα ἐν ᾗ συναπολεῖται πάντα τῷ πονηρῷ· ἐγγὺς ὁ Κύριος καὶ ὃ
μισθὸς αὐτοῦ. For the general belief in the approaching coming of the
Lord see 1 Cor. xv. 52, 1 Th. iv. 15, Rom. xiii. 11, 1 John ii. 18; one
'argument for the lateness of the second epistle of St. Peter is the doubt
expressed on this SubJect (iii. 4) ποῦ ἐστιν ἡ ἐπαγγελία τῆς παρουσίας
αὐτοῦ ; ‘ since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were.'

9. μὴ στενάζετε Κατ’ ἅλλήλων-] Cf. above iv. 11 μὴ καταλαλεῖτε and the
reasons there assigned. The word denotes feeling which is internal
and unexpressed‚ cf. Rom. viii. 23 3 used of secret prayer Mark
vii. 35.

ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε.] See below V. 12 ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε. Ib is a
repetition of the words in the Sermon on the Μ ount, Matt. vii. 1, cf. ib.
v. 23 foll.

πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν ἕστηκεν] Matt. XXiV. 33 ὅταν ἴδητε πάντα ταῦτα γινώσκετε
ὅτι ἐγγύς ἐστιν ἐπὶ θύραις, Apoc. iii. 20 ἰδοὺ ἕστηκα ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν καὶ κρούω,
Ρ11113. flIor. 128 F ἔνιοι μόλις,..πυρετοῦ περὶ θύρας ὄντος ἤδη, θορυβούμενοι
στέλλουσιν ἑαυτούς, J nstin Dial. c. 32 τοῦ βλάσφημα μέλλοντος λαλεῖν
ἤδη ἐπὶ θύραις ὄντος, Eus. HJJ. i. 6. Even to the brethren the Coming
is a warning as well as a comfort and encouragement. Winer p. 152
mentions θύραι in his list of anarthrous words.

10. ὕπόδειγμα-] John xiii. 15 ὑπόδειγμα ἔδωκα ὑμῖν ἵνα καθῶς ἐγὼ
ἐποίησα ὑμῖν καὶ ὑμεῖς ποιῆτε, 2 Pet. ii. 6, Sir. xliv. 16 Ἑνὼχ εὖηρέστησε
Κυρίῳ, ὑπόδειγμα μετανοίας ταῖς γενεαῖς. Phrynichus says the correct
form is παράδειγμα, we find however in Xen. cle re eq. ii. 2 ταῦτα
ὑποδείγματα ἔσται τῷ πωλοδάμνῃ. Spitta compares 4 Maec. 1Χ. 8 ἡμεῖς
διὰ τῆσδε τῆς κακοπαθείας καὶ ὑπομονῆς τὰ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἆθλα οἴσομεν, ib.
xvii. 23 ἇνεκήρυξεν τοῖς στρατίωταις ὡς ὑπόδειγμα τὴν ἐκείνων ὑπομονήν.

κακοπαθίας.] Only here in N.T., used by Malachi i. 13. For the
spelling see W.H. App. p. 153 foll„ and compare above ἐριθία 111. 16,
ἀλαζονίαις, iv. 16. The verb occurs below v. 13. Both are classical.

τοὺς προῴήτας.] How is it that no mention is made of the great
example to which St. Peter refers in the words Χριστὸς ἔπαθεν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν
ὑμῖν ὑπολιμπάνων ὑπογραμμόνὶὶ IS 113 that Christ has already been
alluded to as the Just, or that St. J ames wishes to fix their thoughts
on Him rather as the Lord of Glory than as the pattern of suffering?
