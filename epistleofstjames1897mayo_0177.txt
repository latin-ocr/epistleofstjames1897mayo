HARNAOK ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPIsTLE clvii

hereditary bias, or overwhehning passion, or the l'orcc of circum-
stances or of companionship, all thesc are in 1116 end orslaincd or
permitted by Divine Providence. In my note on the passage I
have quoted froin Homer, from the Proverbs, from Philo, from St.
Paul, as bearing witness to this universal tendency of fallen
humanity.

Nor can I 366 11161 there is anything unprccedentcd or abnorlnal
in the idea that orthodox belief is sufficient for justification.
Justin tells us (Dima, 370 D) this was the idea of the Jews in his
day, who believed that, ‘though they were sinners, yet, if they
knew God, the Lord would not impute sin to them.⁷ Is this at all
more heinous than the belief with which John the Baptist charged
1116 Jews, that, as Abraham's children, they stood 111 110 need of
repentance? Is it more heinous than the belief of the Pharisee
that he should be justified because, unlike 1116 publican, 116 1631611

not in fact Paul's own description of a Jewish Christian (Rom. ii.

of the Church in every age, as well as the experience of every
individual Christian, attests the need of this warning of St. {lanies
against confounding orthodoxy 01 belief with true religion? At
any rate it was so with the many thousands of Pharisaic zealots
belonging to the Church over which St. J 611163 presided.

Another ground on which Julicher denies the genuineness of the
Epistle is that the Greek is too good for Jaines. This objection
has been already answered in p. xli.

The view of the Mosaic law contained in the Epistle is regarded
as proof that it could not have had James for its author. Thus
J 111101161· asks, How could the strict legalist against whom Peter did
not venture to maintain his right to eat with Gentiles (‘ vor dein
Petrus eine Tischgemeinschaft mit Heidenchristen 1110111 zu
vertheidigen gewagt hatte')‚ have written a letter in which no
mention is made of the ceremonial law, in which worship is made
to consist in morality, and in which the perfect law of liberty,
culminating in the royal law of 10176, 13 spoken of with enthusiasni?
