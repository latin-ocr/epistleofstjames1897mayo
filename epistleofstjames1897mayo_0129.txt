Though the letter fiows on from point to point without pretending
to strict logical sequence, yet it 13 easy to distinguish certain
leading principles on which the whole depends. Thus, in regard to
practice, the leading principle is the necessity of whole-heartedness
in religion. A man may think to serve God and Mammon at once
(διψυχία, i. 8, iv, 8), but God insists 011 the surrender of the whole
heart to Him: the love of the world is incompatible with the love
of God (117. 4ή7). Most men seek to compromise matters, and their
religion thus becomes a ὑπόκρισις. They flatter themselves that
they are religious, because they are fluent in speaking on religious
subjects (i. 19, iii. 1); or because they find ‘the words of the
preacher as a lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice ' (i. 19,
22—25); or because they are conscious of genuine indignation at
the sight of error in others (i. 19, 20, iii. 14, iv. 11, 12); or
because of their punctuality in religious observances (i. 26, 27) ; or
because of a partia] obedience to this or that law (ii. 10-12);
or because of their orthodoxy of belief (ii. 14-26); but all this is
mere sels-deception (i. 22, 26, 11. 14, 17, 19, 26, iii. 15). Know-
ledge not used only entails a heavier punishment (iii. 1, 117. 17).
The only religion which is of value in the sight of God is that
which influences the whole life and activity (i. 27, 4, 22-25,
11. 12-26, 111. 13, 17, iv. 11, 17). Faith, love, wisdom, religion—all
alike are spurious if they fail to produce the fruit of good works.
