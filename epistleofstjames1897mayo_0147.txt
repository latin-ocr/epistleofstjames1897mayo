ON THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxvii

think that the grounds for this conclusion have been 0011-
siderably strengthened by the minute comparison made in
a previous Chapter, between the parallel passages in St.
James and in the Epistle to the Romans and the First
Ep1stle of St. Peter. If I arn not greatly mistaken, that
comparison has proved not only that St. Jaines has not copied
from the other Epistles, but that these show distinct traces of hav-
ing been written with reference to his Epistle. The strength how-
ever of the general argument is not to be measured by the strength
of any one line of proof, however irrefragable we may deem it, but
by the cumulative force of many conrerging probabilities. After
having given many years’ study to the subject, I am convinced
that the more closely it is emmined, the more will this hypo-
thesis of the priority of our Epistle be found to meet all diffi-
culties, and explain all the facts of the case.

Those who take a different view suppose that it was either

written by St. James towards the close of his life, or that it is a gs Η S 0

forgery from the hand either of an Ebionite or of a Christian
Essene, whether in the first or second century. The former view
is maintained by Kern (ed. 2), VViesinger, VVoldemar Schmidt,
Bruno Briickner‚ Wordsworth, and Farra1·(E(m'Zgs Days Of Christ-
ianitgy, p. 310 foll).

The reasons assigned by the last-mentioned writer are (1) ‘the
prevalence of the name of Christ, instead of the title the Christ.’
But the name Christ never occurs by itself in this Epistle‚ but only
in the phrase Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, which is found without the article
in every book of the N ew Testament‚ except the Gospel of St.
Luke and the Third Epistle of St. John3 whereas the phrase Ἰησοῦς
ὁ Χριστός 01 ὁ Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς 0001115 nowhere, except in the Acts
(four times) and once in Coloss. ii. 6.

Α second argument is ‘the condition and wide dissemination of
the churches to which it is addressed,' which make it necessary to
assume that ‘many years had elapsed since the day of Pentecost.’
As to this, there is nothing to suggest the wide dissemination of
the churches to which it is addressed, beyond the phrase ‘The
Twelve Tribes of ,the Diaspora‚' which is no doubt wide enough in
conception, but defines nothing as 10 1110 actual extent of country
occupied. It is consistent with two copies sent, say, to Antioch
and to Damascus, or with 0110 hundred copies distributed through-
out the East. All that it implies is that the advice contained in
