what we are
told of
J ames in
Acts xxi.
and our
Epistle.

iv 1 NTRODUOTION

230 words contained in the speech and circular, so many should
reappear in our Episffle, written 011 a totally different subject.
They are as follows: (1) the epistolary salutation χαίρειν (J as. i. 1,
Acts XV. 23), found in only one other passage of the N.T., the letter
of Lysias 10 Felix (Acts xxiii. 26) ; (2) 1110 curious phrase borrowed
from the LXX. which occurs in the N.T. only in Acts XV. 17 ἐφ’
οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς, and James ii. 7 τὸ καλὸν
ὄνομα τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς : (3) ἀκούσατε ἀδελφοί μου found in
James ii. 5 alone in the Epistles, compared with ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ
ἀκούσατέ μου 111 Αο15 xv. 13: (4) ἐπισκέπτεσθαι 3011105 1. 27, Αο15
xv, 14: (5) ἐπιστρέφειν James V. 19, 20, Αο15 xv, 19: (6) τηρεῖν
and διατηρεῖν, 3011105 i. 27 ἄσπιλον ἑαυτὸν τηρεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ κόσμου,
Acts XV. 29 ἐξ ὧν διατηροῦντες ἑαυτοὺς εὖ πράξετε; (7) ἀγαπητός
occurs in the Acts only in xv. 25 σὺν τοῖς ἀγαπητοῖς Βαρνάβα καὶ
Παύλῳ, while ἀδελφοί μου ἀτγαπητοί 15 found three times in our
Epistle: (8) perhaps we may compare also the repetition of the
word ἀδελφός 111 James iv. 11 μὴ καταλαλεῖτε ἀλλήλων ἀδελφοί·
ὁ καταλαλῶν ἀδελφοῦ ἦ κρίνων τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ κρίνει τὸν
νόμον κ.τ.λ. and Acts xv. 23 οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἀδελφοὶ τοῖς κατὰ τὴν
Ἀντιόχειαν...ἀδελφοῖς χαίρειν ; and the pregnant use of the word
ὄνομα 111 3011105 V. 10 ἐλάλησαν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, ver. 14
ἀλείψαντες ἐλαίῳ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι, 11. 7 τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα and in Acts
XV. 14 λαβεῖν ἐξ ἐθνῶν λαὸν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, ver. 26 ὑπὲρ τοῦ
ὀνόματος τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

To return to our immediate subject: 3 ames is seen in the same
position of authority in Acts xxi. 18, when Paul presents himself
before him on his return from his third missionary journey (A.D. 58).
After joining in praise to God for the success which had attended
his labours, J ames and the elders who are with him warn St.. Paul
of the strong feeling against him which had been excited among
the ‘myriads of Jewish believers who were all zealous for the law ’
(ζηλωταὶ τοῦ νόμον) by the report that he had taught the Jews of
the Dispersion to abandon circumcision and their other customs.
To counteract this impression, they recommended him to join in a
Nazarite vow‚ which had been undertaken by four members of their
community, as a proof that the report was unfounded and that 110
himself walked according to the law. The description herc given
of the state of feeling at Jerusalem and of St. 3 ames' anxiety to
avoid causing any offence to it is quite in accordance with the
