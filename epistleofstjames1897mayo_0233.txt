ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES ccxiii

only in quotations from the LXX.: it is said to have been used by
Aristophanes and Menander, but does not occur in their existing
remains. See below, notes on ii. 3, v. 12.

I go on now to Syntcoetz'cal Uscs.

The Article. We found James omitting this, contrary to classical
usage, where the noun was defined by a pronominal genitive, as in
i. 26 χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν ἑαυτοῦ, α’πατῶν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ, v. 20
σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. This license, common in LXX„ is very rare
in the other books of the N.T. except in the first two chapters of
St. Luke and in quotations from the LXX„ cf. Matt. xix. 28 ἐπὶ
θρόνου δόξης αὐτοῦ, Luke i. 15 ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, ver. 25
ἀφελεῖν ὄνειδός μου, ver. 51 ἐν βραχίονι αὕτοῦ...διανοία καρδίας
αὐτῶν, Heb. X. 16 ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν (fr. LXX.), Jude 14 ἐν ἁγίαις
μυριάσιν αὐτοῦ. See above, p. clxxxix. foll.

A similar license found in our Epistle is the omission of the
article when the noun 15 defined by a genitive other than a
pronoun, as in i. 18 ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας, ii. 12 διὰ
νόμου ἐλευθερίας κρίνεσθαι, i. 20 ὀργὴ α’νδρὸς δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ
οὐκ ἐργάζεται. This is very common in the LXX. and occurS, I
think, in all the books of the N.T., especially after a preposition,
eg. 1 Cor. i. 1 διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ, il). ii. 15 τίς ἔγνω νοῦν Κυρίου
vi. 9 Θεοῦ βασιλείαν, x. 21 ποτήριον Κυρίου, Heb. x. 39 εἰς περι-
ποίησιν ψυχῆς, Χ. 28 ἀθετήσας νόμον Μωυσέως, Χ11. 22 πόλει
Θεοῦ ζῶντος, ἐκκλησίᾳ πρωτοτόκων ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν ου’ρανοῖς,
The omission of the article with the attribute, as in ii. 8 νόμον
βασιλικόν, is 1655 frequent except in the combination πνεῦμα
ἅγιον; we find it however in 1 Pet. i. 23 διὰ λόγου ζῶντος, 2 Pet.
ii. 5 ἀρχαίου κόσμου οὐκ ἐφείσατο, ver. 8 ψυχὴν δικαίαν ἐβασάνι-
ζεν, ver. 15 καταλείποντες εὐθεῖαν ὁδόν. See above, p. cxcii. foll.

St. J ames' use of the Pronomz is more idiomatic than is usual in
the N.T. I cannot call to mind any other example of τις used,
like quidam, to soften what might seem a harsh or exaggerated
expression, as in i. 18 α’παρχήν τινα. We have also the double
interrogative ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην ἀνάπτει ,- and the pregnant
use of ὅστις = ‘whereas' in iv. 13, for which compare Acts xvii.
11 οὗτοι ἦσαν εὐγενέστεροι τῶν ἐν Θεσσαλονίκῃ, οἵτινες ἐδέξαντο
τὸν λόγον κ.τ.λ. ‘in that they received the word,' ib. vii. 53,
Rom. i. 25, Phil. iv. 3 with Lightfoot's note, Winer p. 209 n. and
