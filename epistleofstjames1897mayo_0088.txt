lxviii INTRODUOTION
Chrysostom‚ A.D. 347-407.

One quotation will be enough to show how highly he esteemed St. James.

{or hig conngljnts on our Epistle, see the Frafflnenta in Ep. Cath. in Migne
atr. ν. p. .

Orat. de Paenit. v. καὶ εἶ βούλεσθε παράξω ὑμῖν ἀξιόπιστον μάρτυρα, τὸν
ἐδελφόθεον Ἰάκωβον φάσκοντα· ἡ πίστις χωρὶς τῶν ἔργων νεκρά ἐστι.

Lastly Didymus (d. 394), the head of the catechetical school at-

' Alexandria, who ‘caught Jerome and Rufinus, has left brief com-

ments on all the catholic Epistles. Within three years of his
death the Western Church also, at the Council of Carthage (397),
had formally pronounced on the Canonical character of the Episble,

which is quoted like the other Scriptures by J erome and Augustine.
See Bp. Wordsworth in Stud. Bz'bl. I. 128, 129.
