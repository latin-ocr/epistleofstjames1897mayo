70 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

⁴ Looking sideways' would do to express ‘ peeping out of a window ' :
by one who wished not to be seen 3 but in our text παρά seems to imply
the bending of the upper part of the body horizontally‚ cf. παρατείνω,
παραστορέννυμι. In classica] writers we find it sometimes used with
the opposite sense of a careless glance. ag. Dem. 1 Phil. p. 46 τὰ ξενικὰ
παρακύψαντα ἐπὶ τὸν τῆς πόλεως πόλεμον πρὸς Ἀρτάβαζον οἴχεται πλέοντα.
Olement of Rome uses ἐγκύπτω 111 the sense of St. James’ παρακ. as in
i. 40 ἐγκεκυφότες εἷς τὰ βάθη τῆς θείας γνώσεως, where Lightfoot refers
to other passages esp. 45 ἐγκύπτετε εἰς τὰς γραφάς. So also M. Anton.
iv. 3 εἷς ἃ ἐγκύψας, ‘ contemplating which things.’
νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας.] The careful hearer feels that the λόγος
ἀληθείας is, and must be, the law of his life, though a law of freedom ε
it is the ideal on which his eye is to be sured, not a yoke too
heavy for his shoulders to bear. Even of the Mosaic law the
psalmist says (xix. 7) ‘the law of the Lord is perfect,' but this
is merely rudimentary when compared with the law of Christ (Gal.
vi. 2), as is shown in detail in the Sermon on the Momm, and
in the Epis-tle to the Hebrews. St. Paul speaks of himself as
ἔννομος Χριστοῦ (1 Cor. ix. 21), and further describes the new law as
νόμος πίστεως (Rom. iii. 27). It is of this he says in language which
may serve as a comment on St. J ames, ὁ νόμος τοῦ πνεύματος τῆς ζωῆς ἐν
Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ἐλευθέρωσέν με ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου τῆς ἁμαρτίας καὶ τοῦ θανάτου.
Jeremiah prophesied of this law (xxxi. 33) as a new covenant which
should be written on the beart. What led St. J ames to call the Gospel
a law of liberty here and in ii. 122 Olearly he must mean by it a law
not enforced by compulsion from without, but freely accepted as ex-
pressing the desire and aim of the subject of it. Such free obedience is
recognized even in the O.T.‚ Exod. xxxv. 5, Deut. xxviii. 47, Psa. i. 2,
xl. ὅ, liv. 6 ⁶ with a free heart will I sacrifice unto thee‚' cxix. 32 ‘ I
will run the way of thy commandments when thou hast set my heart
at liberty, ib. 45 ‘I will walk at liberty for I seek thy command-
ments,'1 cxix. 97 ‘ O how I love thy law.' This freedom is declared to
be the gift of God, Psa. li. 12 ⁴ stablish me with thy free Spirit‚' cor-
responding to the words of St. Paul (2 Cor. iii. 16) οὗ τὸ πνεῦμα
Κυρίου ἐκεῖ ἐλευθερία. But probably the source of the phrase used
by St. James is his recollection of the words recorded Matt. v. 17
s 's οὐκ ἦλθον καταλῦσαι τὸν νόμον ἀλλὰ πληρῶσαι, and John Viii. 32 γνώσεσθε
τὴν ἀλήθειαν καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια ἐλευθερώσει ὑμᾶς. It is another point in
which St. J ames reminds us of the Stoics, cf. their paradox, ὅτι μόνος
ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος, on Which Cicero (Parad. 34)
comments Quid est libertas ‚2 potestas vivendi ut velis: quis v'yv'tm· vivit
uc vult, m'sz‘ qui recta sequitur, qui yaudet officio, qui leqibus quidem
ozon propter metum paret sed eas sequitur atque colit quia id salutare
maaez'me esse iudicat ? So Ov. Met. i. 90 sponte sua siole Zeye fidem rect-
umque colebat, of the golden age, and Plut. Mor. 780 τίς οἶν ἄρξει τοῦ
ἅρχοντος,· ὁ νόμος, ὁ πάντων βασιλεὺς θνητῶν τε καὶ ἀθανάτων, ὡς ἔφη
Πίνδαρος, οὐκ ἐν βιβλίοις ἔξω γεγραμμένος, ἀλλ’ ἔμψυχος ὢν ἐν αὐτῷ (the
