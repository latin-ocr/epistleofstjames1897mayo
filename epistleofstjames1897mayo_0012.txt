icoireal professions of whatever kind. In its plain positive teachiny
his Epistlc affords a common platforni for Christians of every deyree
os attainnient, from which they may advance ayain with new hope
to such further developments of the saith, as it may be yiven to
each from above to receive and to profit by.

The eiyhth and ninth Chapters of the Introduction deal with the
Cramnzar and Stylc of the Epistle, and, in some deyree, with those
of the New Testamcnt writers yenerally. As a corollarses to these,
I have, in the tenth Chapter, pointed out some objections to the

the Episflc, and the collations of the Codex Patiriensis and Codex
Bobiensis will, I hope, bc found useful by those who are interested in

general connea‘ion of ideas and illustratinq cond cliscussing] the wider
questions involved: and, in the second place, reyardings it as an
integral portion of the canonical Scripture& which are recoynised
by all Christians as authoritatiie in matters of saith, I have to
