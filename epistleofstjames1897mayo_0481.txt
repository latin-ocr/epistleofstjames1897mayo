Ι 19-27 SLOW TO SPEAK 201

reverence, modesty and humility, careful previous consideration of the
subject on which he has to speak, these seem to be the qualities St.
James requires in a toacher, inmun-ast with the flippant familiarity,
the readiness to pour out prayers or exhortations on the shortest
notice, which are often found so attractive. ‘Slow to speak' seems
also to imply a long period of testing and preparation for the work of
the ministry, in contrast with the plan ascribed to the Salvationists, of
taking one who has only just abandoned a life of sin himself, and
setting him up to be an evangelist to others. The words ‘slow to
speak⁷ are applied by Stier to conversation on religious topics as well as
to actual preaching. ‘How many Christians,’ he says, ‘hold that God's
word is a matter about which people must talk together—God's word
which should always speak directly to the heart 1. . . Guard against the
so much loved picus conversations, which are often so unproffiable,
often no more than mere idle babbling. Do not talla away from your
hearts the power and blessing of saving truth) Allowing this to be

· the general rule, we must not forget that the demoniac was bidden to

tell how great things God had done for him3 and that however
unwilling a man may be to set himself up as censor morum or an
instructor of others, it is every one's duty to make confession of his
own belief and principles when occasion calls for it.

Should we limit the injunction to the sphere of religion, or give it a
general application, equivalent to Carlyle's ‘Silence is golden⁷2 Let us
consider the case of one who was certainly ταχὺς λαλεῖν, tue Apostle
Peter. His promptness of speech is shown on many occasions, as
when he said ‘Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord,' ⁶ Let
us make three tabernacles,' ‘Thou art the Christ, the son of the living
God,' ‘ This be far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee‚⁷ ‘Thou
shalt never wash my feet,' ‘Not my feet only but my hands and my
head.’ Here we have the immediate, spontaneous, expression of the
> feelings of the heart, sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but always
attractive and interesting. It is this simplicity and openness which
draws us so much to the Apostle and makes us place such confidence
in his sincerity. So in general, expansiveness and freedom of utter-
ance is both a loveable and useful quality. We do not wish the
natural flow to be checked by the constant question ‘Is what Ι am
about to say wiseZ Is it prudent? How will it affect people⁷s
estimate of me2' On the other hand what can be more wearisome
than a flow of words where there is little of feeling or thoughtZ
words which are mere words, 01· words prompted simply by vanity, or
which betray a, shallow or coarse or malicious nature‘l That a talker
of this kind should be induced to check the current of his words by
asking ‘ Is this true‘.l Is it likely to pain or injure any one‘l Can it do
good to any one 2 ' is surely much to be desired. But even in the case
of natural kindly utterance, some sort of control is desirable. The
impulse to hear should balance the impulse to speak. There should
be the thought that others too may wish to express themselves, and
that the thoughts and experiences of others may be not less interesting
and useful than our own to the company at large. There should be
