148 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

καρπὸν αἴρει αὐτό, Matt. iv. 16, Apoo. ii. 7 τῶ νικῶντι δώσω αὐτῷ
φαγεῖν, esp. after a ielative, as Mark vii. 25 γυνὴ ἧς εἶχεν τὸ θυγά-
τριον αἰτῆς πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον, very common in LXX„ as Exod.iV.17
ῥάβδον’ εν ᾑ ποιήσεις ἐν αὐτῇ τὰ σημεῖα, Amos 1V.7 μερὶς ἐφ ἢν οὗ βρεξω
ἐπ αὐτην ξηρανθήο-εται, 566 Winei p. 184, who gives instances fiom
classical Greek. Examples of the infinitive after οῖδα 111 this sense are
found in 2 Pet. ii. 9, Matt. vii. 11. The word καλόν 15 common with
St. James (ii. 7, iii. 13) as with St. Paul (Rom. vii. 18, 19, 21, 2 Cor.
xiii. 7, Gal. vi. 9, where the phrase ποιεῖν τὸ καλόν occurs). The anar-
throus neuter occurs in the similar phrase πᾶς ποιῶν πονηρόν Mal. ii. 17.
For the thought see Luke xii. 47, John ix. 41, xiii. 17, Philo M. 2.
p. 518 τῷ μὲν ἀγνοίᾳ τοῦ κρείττονος διαμαρτάνοντι συγγνώμη δίδοται· ὁ δ’ ἐξ
ἐπιστήμης ἀδικῶν ἀπολογίαν οὐκ ἔχει. The appeal to knowledge here, as
above i. 19, is a proof that the writer is addressing Christians.

V. 1.——The persons here addressed are not the same as those addressed
in iv. 13. It is no longer the careless worldliness of the bustling trader
which is condemned, but the more deadly worldliness of the unjust
capitalist or landlord. It is a question whether they are Christians
or not. That there were rich members of the Ohurch appears from i. 10,
ii. 2, iv. 13 and St. Paul's warnings against the love of riches. On the
other hand ‘the brethren¹ in v. 7 seem to be opposed to ‘the rich⁷
here 3 and the prophets, whom St. James imitates, did not confine
their threats and warnings to Israel : we have the burden of Moab and
Egypt as well as of Israel. If we suppose the words uttered first of all
with reference to disbelievers‚ they will still be applicable to all who
in any respect follow in their footsteps.

ἄγε νῦν,] See above iv. 13. For severity towards the rich cf. Luke
vi. 24, xviii. 24, 1 Tim. vi. 9, 10, Prov. xi. 28, Amos iii. 10, v. 11, viii.
4 foll„ Isa. V. 8, xxxiii. l, Jer. iv. 8.

ὀλολύζοντες] Only here in N.T.: it is used in Hom. Il. Vi. 297 and
Herod. iv. 189, of the joyful outcries of women in the worship of
Athene ; 111 the LXX. it occurs only as the expression of violent grief,
as in J oel i. 5, 13, Isa. xiii. 6 (of Babylon) ὀλολύζετε· ἐγγὺς γὰρ ἡμέρα
Κυρίου, ib. XiV. 31 ὀλολύξατε πύλαι πόλεων, ι’ὂ.Χν. 3 ὀλολύξατε μετὰ κλαυθ-
μοῦ, ib. xvi. 7, J er. iv. 8. So Latin ululatus.

ἐπὶ ταῖς ταλαιπωρίαις ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις] The early Christi-ans Were in*
momentary expectation of the second coming of the Lord, when the
world and its lusts would pass away (v. 8) : cf. 011 the ὠδῖνες, the suffer·
ings which precede his appearance, 4 Ezra v. and the prophecies of Dan.
xii. 1, Matt. xxiv. partially fulfilled in the siege of Jerusalem, in
which some of those here addressed would probably be involved, as
many who had come up for the Feast were surprised by the rapid con—
centration of the Roman armies.

2. cdo-mre] Prophetical perfect as in Isa. xl. ⁶), xliv. 23, xlvi. 1, xlix.
13, lii. 9, liii. 3-10‚1x. 1. The velb σ. 15 only found here 111 N. T„ the
active occurs with transitive foi ce J ob xl. 7 σῆψον τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς, the pass.
ib. XXXiii. 21, Psa. xxxvii. 5, Sirao XiV. 19 πᾶν ἔργον σηπόμενον ἐκλειπει.
It 15 questioned whether the expi ession is intended litei ally of wealth
which, like the manna, will not keep, e.g. of stores accumulated to 5611
