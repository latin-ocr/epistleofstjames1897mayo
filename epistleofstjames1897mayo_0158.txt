cxxxviii INTRODUCTION

epistles are better expressed and more logically handled, the phrases used are
inore exact and appropriate in the former than in the latter. For instance the
exhortation to rejoice in tribulation is common to both ; but in Peter we 666
that there is real occasion for it ; 111066 whom he addresses are actually in the
midst of a fiery trial, suffering for righteousness' sake (iii. 14, iv. 12) 3 this per-
secution is the work of the devil whom they resist by their patient endurance
(V. 8, 9) 3 they are bidden to exult, not in their trial itself, but in the glory
which is to follow, the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time (i. 5, iv.
13) 3 they are encouraged by the reminder of their high calling (i. 3, ii. 9, 20,
21, iii. 14, 816), by 1116 example of Christ whose sufferings they share (ii. 21, iii.
18, iv. 13), and by the hope of the promised reward (i. 4, 7). The tone of the
epistle is throughout that of hopefulness, and the exultant joy in tribulation
is only the issue and climax of this hopefulness. In James it is just the
reverse : he borrows the phrase ‘ manifold temptation,' but there is no special
appropriateness in it; those whom 116 addresses are not suffering persecution
from the heathen: so too he borrows the phrase ‘resist the devil‚' but this
is not wnnected with the general thought of tria13 116 bids them rejoice 111
tribulaffion, hut he gives no reason for their doing 60; 116 has not prepared
the way for it by 1116 spirit-stirring appeals and encouragements of Peter3 if
lissii‘igffi to the future it is only to remind them of the ‘terrible coming of the

Now to examine this: could any one imagine from Br'uckner's
description that St.. James grounds his exhortation to rejoice, 011
the fact that trial works endurance, and endurance Christian
perfection (i. 2—4) ’.ἰ could he imagine that it is J ames who says,
he who endures trial will receive the crown of life, the kingdom
promised to all that love God (i. 12, ii. 5)2 that it is James who
speaks of the profession of Christianity as in itself a patent of
nobility (i. 9), and refers to the fact of Christ's being the glory of
Christians as annihilating all earthly distinctions (ii. 1) 2 It is 110
doubt true that he puts in the fore-front of his Epistle the high-
toned, uncompromising· summons to rise superior to human
weakness, and rejoice in what the world thinks misery. I have
elsewhere spoken of this as an instance of the stoicism of St.
James, and pointed ont how the sanie demand is sostened down
by the gentler and more sympathetic Apostle. But it is not more
stoical than it 16 Christ-like: it is a reminiscence, like so much
besides, of the actual words of his divine Brother, ‘ Blessed are ye
that weep now3 blessed are ye when 111611 shall hate you, and
separate you froin their company, and cast out your name as evil
for the Son of man's sake3 rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy?
If Christ did not shrink from this sublime paradox, if paradox was
one of the most efficient weapons used by Him as well as by older
reformers, by Socrates and the Stoics‚ to shake men out of their
slumbers and rouse them to aim at a new and higher ideal, why

are we to dispute St. James's right to use it, as if it could only be
