clxxxiv INTRODUCTION

assertion made about the noun is not more true of one member
of the class than of another. This is naturally expressed by the
English indefinite article in such passages as i. 6 ἔοικεν κλύδωνι,
where the comparison is to a wave generally, not to any particular
wave3 so in iii. 12 μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας ποιῆσαι; and ii. 18
ἐὰν ἀδελφὸς-ἢ ἀδελφὴ (γυμνοὶ ὑπάρχωσιν, ii. 24 ἐξ ἔρνγων δικαιοῦται
ἄνθρωπος, i. 23 ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ.

When the class as a whole is spoken of, the article is used either
with the collective noun, as ἡ ἐκκλησία V. 14 ; or with the plural of
the persons or things composing the class, as οἱ πλούσιοι 11. 6, τῶν
ἵππων 111. 3, τοὺς ἀνθρώπους iii. 93 or with one such person or
thing, considered as typica] or representative of the class (the
‘ generic ' article), eff. ὁ πλούσιος 1. 11, ἡ πηγή iii. 11, ὁ «γεωρνγός
v. 7. If the article is omitted, the plural denotes that some of the
class are concerned in the assertion, without saying anything as to
the rest of the class, as κᾶν ἁμαρτίας ᾖ πεποιηκώς V. 15, πλῆθος
ἁμαρτιῶν V. 20, ἐξ ἕρνγων δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος 11. 24, ἕλκουσιν
ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια 11. 6. v

If two or more nouns denoting different persons or things are
joined by καί, the article is regularly repeated with each, as in iii.
11 τὸ «γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ πικρόν, but if the nouns taken together
are regarded as denoting or constituting one person or thing, the
article is only used with the first, as in iii. 9 εὐλονγοῦμεν τὸν Θεὸν
καὶ Πατέρα.

One case in which the Greek use of the article agrees with
French and German in opposition to the English is that of
abstractions such as ἡ δόξα, ἡ πίστις, which are thus, as it were,
personified and looked at as something existing apart from the
person or action with which they are concerned, cf. ii. 17 ἡ πίστις’,
ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα, νεκρά ἐστιν, 11. 20, 22 ἡ πίστις συνήργει τοῖς
ἕρνγοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἕρτγων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη, where
R. V. has ‘Faith wrought with his works and by works was
saith made perfect.' In the oblique cases the article is generally
omitted unless (as in i. 2 τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως, ii. 1 τὴν
πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν) the noun is defined by the context.
Thus we have ii. 14 ἐὰν πίστιν λένγῃ τις ἔχειν and 1. 6 αἰτείτω ἐν
πίστει, because it is not faith absolute, saith as a sels-existent
idea, which is spoken of, but merely saith relative, a quality
attributed to an act or an individual. So ii. 24 ἐξ ἔρνγων
δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος καὶ οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως μόνον ‘from actions, not
