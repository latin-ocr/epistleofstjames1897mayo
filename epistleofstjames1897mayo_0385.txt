body also.' The natural apodosis to such a protasis would be ‘ let us
also for the same purpose put a bridle in our own lips.' The present-
apodosis adds nothing to the clause εῑς τὸ πείθεσθαι, and it is difficult to
find any natural meaning for δέ 31 the beginning of the verse: even
the καί 111 3110ᾶο515 15 out of place 3 it would have been natural if the
protasis 113111ὐ11εῖτὸ στόμα μετάγομεν. Lastly, the καί after ἰδού 111
ver. 4 seems to look back to the preceding ἴδε. De Wette and
Beyschlag felt these difficulties so strongly that they included the
whole verse in the protasis and explained the construction 35 311
aposiopesis. Thus the latter translates ‘ XVenn wir aber den Pferden

ihren ganzen Leib regieren, so 50111011 wir es doch auch uns selbst thun,

Leibes sittlich machtig werden’3 and refers, for examples of aposio-
pesis after εἰ, 10 Luke xix. 42, Acts xxiii. 9, Mark vii. 11, which
however are very unlike the present. In fact such an aposiopesis

the writer: it is only suggested as a last resource by editors who
felt themselves bound to this reading on the mistaken view of the
overwhelming evidence in its favour, andin obedience to the hazardous
maxim that the more difficult reading is always to be preferred. No
doubt a copyist will avoid, if he 0311, 3 difficulty which stares him
