200 COMMENT

vocation‘.l Are not some men called to be artists, poets, philosophers,
students or teachers, as other men are called to be men of business
and action‘l Is not action itself crippled and wasted from want of
knowledge‘l Is it not one of the most deplorable features of modern
life, that there is so much restless activity with so little thought as to
the end to be pursued, and the means to be employed for arriving at
the end3 so much talk and profession, and so little feeling 3 so much
fuss, and so little real enjoyment‘l

We may allow all this, and yet hold with Bp. Butler and St. J ames,
that it is a disastrous thing for a man to rest satisfied with his own
‘passive impressionss If a poet like Wordsworth devotes himself
steadily to the task of raising the standard of thought and feeling
among his countrymen, or a jurisprudent, such as Bentham‚ lives
laborious days in order to reform men's ideas of what law should be,
and so ultimately to bring about that vast improvement in the statute
law of England which has been witnessed in this century, no one
could deny that these were in the highest sense men of action. It is
true there have been artists and philosophers who were less consciously
practical, ‘who sang but as the linnets sing‚' who wrote or composed
in obedience to the inner impulse without any definite idea of
benefiting others 3 whose work nevertheless has been rich in practical
results of the greatest importance. Here too, for the work to produce
such results, there must have been a high degree of mental activity.
and a conscientious effort to render faithfully the impression or the
thought by· which the writer or artist was possessed. To borrow St.
James⁷ figure, no great work of art was ever produced by a mere hasty
glance at the mirror of the Divine Word. But St. J ames is of course
speaking primarily of moral and spiritual truth. He does not deny
that one who preaches or theorizes on these subjects without prac-
tising his own precepts may put forward thoughts which may be good
and useful for other men3 nor that he may even be a medium, like
Balaam, for divine inspiration, though he should be found in the end
fighting, like Balaam, for the enemies of God: but what he says is
that, to the theorizer himself, moral theory without practice is of no

avail, but rather a dangerous snare as fostering the habit of self-
deception.

SLow To SPEAK.

But is it not the duty of a Christian to let his light shine? to·
preach the Gospel to every creature? Does not the Psalmist say
(lxxii. 74), ‘ my mouth shall speak of thy righteousness all the day,' and
St. James himself (V. 20) give a special encouragement to one who
‘ converts a sinner from the error of his way ’2 On the other hand, in
ch. iii„ he warns his readers against being too ready to take upon
themselves the office of teacher, and urges on them the necessity of
controlling the tongue. Doubtless we are to understand him in the
text as deprecating rash and hasty speech on religious subjects, in
accordance with the teaching of the wise man, ⁶ God is in heaven and
thou on earth 3 therefore let thy words be few' (Eccl. v. 1, 2). A grave
