(xi. 1), that those who are rich in saith are heirs os the promised
kingdom (ii. 5). By this saith 116 11163115 111151 111 1116 loving will of'
God revealed to us in Christ, and the reception of His word into our·
souls‚ as seed into a good soil (i. 17, 18, 21). If we retain our trust
in God's all-wise, just and loving Provide-nce, in spite of the trials
which He permits, the habit of endurance is strengthened in us and
thus we grow up to the full stature of Christian manhood (1. 4). The
opposite to saith is worldliness : our saith is shown to 106 tainted with
worldliness if we favour the rich above the poor (i. 27, ii. 2—4). In
the verses which we have now to deal with, saith appears in a different
light. It is no longer the essence 01 Christianity, but a mere dead
semblance, or empty profession 01 saith. For the employment os the
same word πίστις 10 denote the two kinds of saith, we may compare the
different meanings 01πειρασμός and πειράζεσθαι 111 1. 2, and 13, the
former used of a tempting for good, the latter of a tempting for evil 3
the use of σοφία 10 express both a heavenly and an earthly wisdom
in iii. 15, 17, 1 Cor. i. 17-11. 16 (and so of πανουργία in Sir. XXi. 12 3 also
the use of ἔρις 111 Hesiod (Op. 11—30) sor the emulation which is good,
and the quarrelsomeness which is hurtful). This use 011116 same name
for different things 15 natural enough in the rough and ready speech
of men little accustomed to metaphysical analysis or subtle refinements
of language, and would be intentionally adopted by those who had to·
address such hearers. The change 01 meaning is however prepared for
here by the use os the word λέγῃ 111 ver. 14 : not saith in itself, but the
profession of saith 15 declared to be 01 110 avail. The thought os faith-
is apparently suggested hythe statement in Ver. 13 that ‘love (com-
passion) is the only thing which can triumph over judgment,' judgment
being without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. To this an objec-
tion is supposed to be made by the worldly-minded Christian of ver, 1 ε
‘ Will not saith also triumph against judgment? What is the good of

paarble 01 1116 talking philanthropist. Just as a profession os philan-
thropy unaccompanied by kind actions is of no good to the needy, so a
profession 01 saith unaccompanied by righteous actions is os no good to*
ourselves 3 both are alike a mere hypocrisy in the sight of God. Such
profession is indeed the dead carcase of genuine religion. But in the
midst of this diatribe against a dead saith, St. J ames gives some further
particulars os 3 true saith, such 33 Α1013113111’3 (ver. 22) : ‘ saith

If St. James were not so fully justified by the subsequent history of
the Church, we might be inclined to wonder at the scathing words in
which he expresses his contempt for those who place their confidence
in the orthodoxy of their creed. But it may be questioned whether
any form of fetishism has been quite so mischievous, so destructive to-
all kindly feeling as well as to moral and spiritual and intellectu-al
progress, as the setish 01 orthodoxy, i.e. the idea that the assent to a
