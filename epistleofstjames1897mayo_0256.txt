ccxxxvi INTRODUOTION

But can we suppose that the son of a Galilean carpenter would
have been capable of writing such idiomatic Greek? We have
seen above (p. xli.) that Galilee was studded with Greek towns,
and that it was certainly in the power of any Galilean to gain a
knowledge of Greek; even if he were, as Prof. Neubauer holds,
brought up in ignorance of any language but Aramaic‚ and not, as
Prof. T. K. Abbott is inclined to believe, speaking Greek as freely
as Aramaic.1 We know also that the neighbouring town of Gadara
was celebrated as an important seat of Greek learning and litera-
ture, and that the Author of our Epistle shows an acquaintance
with ideas and phrases which were probably derived, mediately 01·
immediately, from the Stoic 11111108οῙ111018.2 If we call to mind
further that he seems to have paid particular attention to the
sapientia] books, both canonical and apocryphal, and that a main
point in these is to encourage the study of ‘the dark sayings of
the wise '3 that the wisdom of Edom and Teman is noted as
famous by some of the prophets,3 and that the interlocutors in
the book of Job are assigned with probability to this and neigh-
bouring regions 3-——taking into account all these consideration& we
may reasonably suppose that our author would not have scrupled to
avail himselfof the opportunities within his reach‚ so as to master the
Greek language‚ and learn something of Greek philosophy. This
would be natural, even if we think of J ames as impelled only by a
desire to gain wisdom and knowledge for himself, but if we think
of him also as the principle teacher of the Jewish believers, many

of Palestlne at the time of the Christian era were bilingual, and illustrates the
occasional use of Aramaic by our Lord from the parallel case of lrish phrases in the
mouth of Irishmen who habitually speak English. The Rev. G. H. Gwilliam,
whom I had consulted as to the relation of the language of the Peshitto to Armnaic,
writes that ‘he prefers to speak of the vcrnacular of Palestine, rather than to use
the term Ara1naic‚' because the vernacular of Palestine in the first century of the
Christian era “included many dialects‚ some of which were extremely corrupt. In

spoken: in Galilae, it appears that the common tongue was a very mixed dialect,
and accordlng to Deutsch (Romaim, The Talmud, p. 42) Palestinian patois was a
mere Jargon. Amongst these many forms of speech I find no place for Syriae pro-
perly so called. The language of the Peshitto was the language of Edessa. It
was closely related to Chaldee and Samaritan, and indeed not very far removed,
after all, from Hebrew. It is a curious question, which Ι 0111 not prepared to answer,

whether one who habitually spokc one of these dialects, could easily understand a

speaker-in another of them. I suspect there were considerable differences of pro-
