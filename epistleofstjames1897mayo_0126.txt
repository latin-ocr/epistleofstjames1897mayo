CHAPTER V
THE CONTENTS OF THE EPISTLE

The design of the Epistle is on the one hand to encourage those
to whom it is addressed to bear their trials patiently, and on the
other hand to warn them against certain errors of doctrine and
practice.

I. Of Tricca—i. 1-18.

(1) Trial is sent in order to perfect the Christian character.
That it may have this effect wisdom is needed; and this wisdom is
given in answer to believing prayer.—i. 2-6.

A warning against double—-mindedness. The believer should
recognize the greatness of his calling, and not allow
himself to be either elated or depressed by outward
circu mstances.—i. 7-1 1.

(2) Patient endurance of trial leads to the crown of life

promised to all that love God.—i. 12.

(3) Though outward trial is appointed by God for our good, We
must not imagine that the inner weakness which shows itself u'nder
trial is from God. God is perfect goodness, and only sends what is
good. The disposition to misuse God's appointments comes froin
man’s own lusts, which, if yielded to, lead 130 death as their natural
consequence—i. 13-15.

(4) So far from God's tempting man to evil, it is only by His
will, through the regenerating power of His word, that we have
been raised to that new and higher life which shall eventually
penetrate and renew the whole creation—i. 16-18.

II. How we should receive the word—i, 19-27.

(1) As humble listeners‚ not as excited speakers.—i. 19-21.
(2) Nor is it enough to listen to the word3 we must carry it 0111,
in action—i. 22-24.
