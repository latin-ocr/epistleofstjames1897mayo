persecution against the Church at Jerusalem, and which was
followed by the mission of Saul to Damascus (and doubtless by
that of other emissaries to other parts of the Diaspora), bearing
letters from the high priest to excite the authorities 01 1110
synagogues against the Christians. The tone used by St. James
in reference to the trials 01 1110 Christians does not imply, as the
tone of St. Peter would seem to do, that the persecution was then
either at its height or immediately impending (1 Pet. iv. 12), but
rather to the sequel 01 a persecution with its πειρασμοὶ ποικίλοι
01 animosities excited and losses endured‚ of liability to insults
and to interference with their religious services, as in Heb. X. 32.
11 111030 addressed were still suffering under severe persecut-ioris
we should have heard less 01 their petty rivalries and worldly
scheming. As to 13110 position 01 St. James in the Church of
Jerusalem, the first intimation we have 01 it is in Gal. i. 18, where
St. Paul mentions that he saw him and St. Peter on his visit to
Jerusalem three years after his conversion. A more certain proof
of it may be found in Peter's message, sent to him on the occasion
01 1113 escape from prison in 44 A.D. (Acts xii. 17). Lastly the
picture given of the Church is not that 01 one just founded. A
circular letter cannot 01 0011130 take note of the special circum-
stances 01 each individual congregation, and it is quite possible
and even probable that some of those addressed may have only
lately received the Gospel, but it is evident that the majority must
have been Christians 01 301110 years⁷ standing. Taking into
account these various considerations we may perhaps name the
year 40 A.D., as the earliest, and 50 A.D.1 as the latest, at which the
Epistle could have been written.

This is pretty much the conclusion which has been arrived at by
the majority 01 recent editors and others who have treated

nof the date 01 1110 Epistle; 30 that we may say that it is now

generally recognized as being the earliest portion of the New Testa-
ment. This is the view of Schneckenburger (Aomwt. p. 138,
Beitrciqc 200 ff), Neander (Plantiuq os tlte Christian Olwm‘eh,
Eng. tr. 1842), Von Hofmann, Huther, Beyschlag (Gomon. and
Theoi. Stud. u. Krit. for 1874), Erdinann, Schegg, Alford, Plumptre,
Ritschl (Altkatholische Kz‘rclm ed. 2), Weiss (Einlm'tszmq, 1886,
p. 7 06 soll), P. Ewald (Havptproblem, 1890), Mangold's edition of
Bleek's Einleitmzy, 1886, pp. 706, 713, Lechler, Apostolic cmd
