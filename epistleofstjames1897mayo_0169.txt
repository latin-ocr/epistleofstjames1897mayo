ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxlix

the appeal to the example of Elijah‚ Job and the prophets instead

of Christ, the phrase ⁴ Lord of Sabaoth‚' the warning against the

use of Jewish oaths, the stern censure of landowners who withheld

the wages of the reapers, suit the circumstances of the Christians

of Rome in that age 2 YVhere were the free labourers referred to?

The latifundia of Italy were worked by slaves. Lastly, the writer

looks for the immediate coming of the Lord to judgment (v. 7-9),

Do we find any instance of a like confident expectation in any

, writer of the latter half of the second century?

Some of my readers may wonder at my spending so much time Τίμῖὲὲωξὲιὲλη

on the examination of what will strike them as mere arbitrary inenessiof

hypothesis. My reason for doing so is (1) that we English are so Οῗιξιιξῖἶῗέιθ

conscious of what we owe to German industry and research, that fiffisgiiiiiexfi

partly from our sense of the seriousness of the practical issues
involved, and partly from our trust in the perfect fairness, the
exhaustive learning and the sound historical and literary judg-
ment of the great scholar and theologian whom we have recently
lost. What Bishop Lightfoot has tested and approved, we believe
we may accept as proven, so far as present lights go. But (2)
fanciful and one-sided as German criticism often is, it is constantly
stimulating and suggestive, bringing to light new facts or putting
old facts in a new light. And therefore on both grounds, for the
sake of what we may learn from it, as well as to point out its
shortcomings and exaggerations‚ I have thought it worth while to
lay its last word before English readers. Ι have done my best to
examine fairly point by point the argument in favour of the
late origin of our Epistle ; but it is impossible to estimate fully its
strength or its weakness, unless we view it in connexion with the
general theory, first put forward by F. C. Bam, of which it forms a
part. According to that theory the larger portion of the writings
of the New Testament are forgeries of the second century. I
have endeavoured to show the improbability of this theory in the
case of one small Epistle. Others have done the same for other
books of the New Testament. But the improbability attaching to

the theory as affecting one or another separate book of the New
