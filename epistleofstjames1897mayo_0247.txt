ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF ST. JAMES ccxxvii

twelve lines in the epistle to the Hebrews‚ and of more than
twenty in the epistle to the Ephesians. The complexity of the
sentences in these epistles and in St. Paul's writings generally
arises from the accumulation (1) of relative clauses, one depending
on another, as in Col. i. 24-29 ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἡ
ἐκκλησία, ἧς ἐγενόμην διάκονος...τοῖς ἁγιόις αὐτοῦ, οἷς
ἠθέλησεν ὁ Κύριος γνωρίσαι τί τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης...ὅ ἐστιν
Χριστὸς...ὃν ἡμεῖς καταγγέλλομεν...ει’ς ὃ καὶ κοπιῶ, (2) of
participles, including genitives absolute, as in Heb. ix, 6-10 τούτων
δὲ οὕτως κατεσκευασμένων..,εἰσίασιν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὰς λατρείας
ἐπιτελοῦντες.. τοῦτο δηλοῦντος τοῦ πνεύματος...ἕτι τῆς πρώτης
σκηνῆς ἐχούσης τάξιν...καθ’ ἢν θυσίαι προσφέρονται μὴ
δυνάμεναι τελειῶσαι τὸν λατρεύοντα, Col. ii. 13-15 συνεζωοποίησεν
ἡμᾶς αὐτῷ, χαρισάμενος τὰ παραπτώματα, ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ’
ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον...καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου προσηλώσας...
ἀπεκδυσάμενος...καὶ ἐδειγμάτισεν...θριαμβεύσας αὐτούς, (3) of
prepositional phrases, as in Eph. i. 3 εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεὸς . .. ὁ εὐλογήσας
ἡμᾶς ἐν πάσῃ εὐλογία ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις ἐν Χριστῷ, καθὼς
ἐξελέξατο ἡμᾶς ἐν αὐτῷ πρὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, εἶναι ἡμᾶς
ἀμώμους κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ προορίσας ἡμᾶς εἰς
υἱοθεσίαν διὰ Ἰησοῦ εἰς αὐτόν, κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν...ει’ς
ἔπαινον τῆς χάριτος ἧς ἐχαρίτωσεν ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ, ἐν
ᾦ ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν διὰ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἄφεσιν
τῶν παραπτωμάτων, κατὰ τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ, ἧς
ἐπερίσσευσεν εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐν πάσῃ σοφία...γνωρίσας τὸ μυστήριον
...κα τὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ ἢν προέθετο ἐν αὐτῷ εἰς οἰκονομίαν
...ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι τὰ πάντα ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ, τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς
οὐρανοῖς καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐν αὐτῷ, ἐν ᾧ κ.τ.λ. This sentence
may stand as an epitome of the other ways in which St. Paul fills
out his sentences : eg. (4) with nouns in apposiffion, as τὴν ἄφεσιν;
(5) with epexegetic infinitive, as εἶναι ἡμᾶς, ἀνακεφαλαιώσασθαι.
St. James, on the other hand, never doubles the relative, never
uses genitive absolute, does not accumulate prepositions‚ or use the
epexegetic infinitive—-in a word, never allows his principal sentence
to be lost in the rank luxuriance of the subordinate clauses,
This appears plainly from the following statistics. The number of
simple sentences, i.e. sentences having no subordinate finite verb,
in the Epistle is 140 according to my reckoning. I include in
this all co-ordinate clauses. The number of sentences with a
single subordinate clause is 42. I include here subordinate clauses
