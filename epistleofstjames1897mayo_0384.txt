104 THE EPIsTLE OF ST, JAMES

references to judgment in this epistle are ii. 12, 13, v. 9, 12. By the
use of the first person (corrected to the second in the Vulgate)‚ St.
James includes himself among the teachers whom he warns, asin v.
9, ii. 18, cf. 1 John i. 6, 11. 18 with WVestcott’s notes, so St. Paul
l Cor. X. 6 foll, Heb. ii. 3, xii. 25, Ignat. Eplc. 3 οὐ διατάσσομαι ίμῖν
ὡς ὤν τις..,νῧν γὰρ ἀρχὴν ἔχω τοῦ μαθητεύεσθαι καὶ προσλαλῶ ὑμῖν ὡς

συνδιδασκαλίταις μου.
2. πολλὰ, πταίομεν ἅπαντες] 1 John 1. S ; ΧῩΘἙΞῈΘῘΠ cites many similar

sayings from heathen writers, eg. Thuc. iii. 45 πεφύκασιν ἅπαντες καὶ
ἰδίᾳ καὶ δημοσίᾳ ἁμαρτάνειν, Seneca Clem. i. 6 pecccmnus omnes, alii
yram'a, alii leviora. For πολλὰ see Mark ix. 26 πολλὰ σπαράξας ἐξῆλθεν,
for πταίειν above ii. 10, 2 Pet. i. 10, Jude 24 τῷ δυναμένῳ φυλάξαι ὑμᾶς

ἀπταίστους-

εἰ’ τις ἐν λόγῳ οὐ πταίει] For εἰ οὐ See above 1. 23, ii. ll: for the
thought Matt. xii. 37 ἐκ τῶν λόγων σου δικαιωθήσῃ καὶ ἐκ τῶν λόγων σου
καταδικασθήσῃ, ih. XV. 11 τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος, τοῦτο κοινοῖ
τὸν ἄνθρωπον, 1 Pet. iii. lO, Prov. Vi. 2 παγὶς ἰσχυρὰ ἀνδρὶ τὰ ἰ’δια χείλη,
XV. 4, ἴασις γλώσσης δένδρον ζωῆς, Sirac. XiV. 1 μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐκ
ὠλίσθησεν ἐν στόματι αὐτοῦ, ib. xix. 16, XXV. S, xxviii. 12-26, Philo M.
1. 615 τὸ μὲν οὖν ἄριστον καὶ τελεώτατον τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, μηδὲ ἐνθυμοῦσθαί τι
τῶν ἀτοπωτάτων κ.τ.λ., ib. 695 τοῦ δὲ σοφοῦ ἴδιον τοῖς ὑπὲρ ἡδονῆς καὶ
ἐπιθυμίας λόγοις ὑπαντιάσαι ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος καὶ τῆς γλώσσης, ἅπερ ἦν
ὄργανα λόγου. παγίως γὰρ ἐπιβὰς αὐτοῖς δυνήσεται τὰς συνηγορούσας τῷ
πάθει πιθανότητας ἀνατρέψαι.

οὗτος τέλειος ἀνὴρ] οὗτος marks the apodosis as in 1. 2 3. For ἀνήρ see

above i. 83 for τέλειος i. 4.

χαλιναγωγῆσαι] See on i. 26, ancl cf. Philo M. 1. p. 196 (the true-
man within each) ἐπιστομίζων ταῖς τοῦ συνειδότος ἡνίαις τὸν αὐθάδη καὶ
μετὰ ἀφηνιασμοῦ δρόμον γλώττης ἐπέσχεν, ib. p. 314.

καὶ ὅλον τὸ σῶμα] Repeated in vv. 3 and 6. The figure of χαλ. is
further carried out: by the bridle in the mouth we turn the horse as
we will, so by controlling our words we can regulate our whole activity.
We find the opposition of one member to the whole body, Matt. v. 29

3. ἰ’δε γάρ] WH. with RV. and all the recent editors (except
Hofmann and Bassett, who keep ἴδε) read εἰ δέ. The evidence is as
follows: AB with some inferior MSS. read ΕΙΔΕ, Vulg. and Corb. si
autem ,· Sin. ΕΙΔΕ ΓΑΡ, (Sia-² omits γάρ), Pesh. ecce enim ,· Cod. Ephr.
with many inferior MSS. and Theophyl. and Euth. Zig. in comment
ΙΔΕ, Egyptian, Ethiopian and later Syriae versions ecce. The con-
fusion between ει and ι being extremely common,1 it is important to2
observe (1) that the insertion of γὰρ in Sin. seems to show that the
preceding ειδε must be taken as an imperative (so B. Weiss, p. 34 ‘ das
eingeschaltete γαρ zeigt dass ιδε gemeint ist ') 3 (2) that this view is

¹ Field compares Rom. ii. 17, where the old reading ἴδε σὺ Ἰουδαῖος has been
changed to εἴ δέ by late editors, misled by the spelling of the majority of the uncial
MSS, as in our text, and with equally disastrous effect on the construction. He
points out that Sin. has εἴδου for ἴδοι] in Luke xxiii. 15, εἴδετε for ἴδετε Luke xxiv.
39, 1 John iii. 1. Below v. 11 the MSS. are nearly equally divided between ἴδετε
and εἴδετε. 111 Luke vi. 3 Cod. D lias εἴδε sor ἴδε. These variations not being given
in Bruder can only be ascertainecl by examining the MSS. In Epictetus, where ἴδε
