I. 1—13Pa1-aphrase.

‘³ Bejoice when you meet with trials (temptations) of whatever kind,
hnowiny that these are clesiyneol to prove your faith ancl fise in you
the habit of patient enclurance, with a view to your attainment of
the perfect Christian character. To malae the riyht use of trial there
is neecl of wisclom, which must be souyht by prayer from Him who
yives freely without upbraicliny for past neylect or inyratitucle.
[But prayer, to be effectual, must be the utterance of a fioeed purpose
which is in no danger of being] divertecl by chanyiny moccls or cir-

has been thus approved shall receive the crown of life promised to all

the author of his temptation, for Gal, as he is incapable of being]
temptecl, so He tcmpts none. Each man is tempteol by his own lust (im-
pulse), by which he is carried away from riyht ancl„ allurecl to wrong] .·
lust, when it has conceivezl, becomes the parent of sin; sin when
maturecl brinys forth elcath.
