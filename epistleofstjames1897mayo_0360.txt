80 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

epistle 10 the Hebrews it is shown to be imminent.’ So we read in
Acts vi. 19 of Christians belonging to the synagogue of the Libertines3
in Acts XV. 21 it seems to be implied that the Jewish Christians
still heard Moses read in the synagogue every sabbath-day ; ib. ix. 4
Saul takes letters to the synagogues in Damascus bidding them
to purge themselves of Christian members, cf. xxii. 19 ἐγῶ ἤμην
φυλακίζων καὶ δέρων κατὰ τὰς συναγωγὰς τοὺς πιστεύοντας ἐπὶ σέ. After-
wards in his missionary journeys St. Paul regularly begins by preaching
in the synagogues (Acts xiii. 14, 43 3 xiV. 1 3 xvii. l, 2, 10, 17 3 xviii. 4,
26 ; xix. 8) 3 in Corinth we hear of his leaving the synagogue in con—
sequence 01 the violent opposition of the Jews and making use of
an adjoining house (Acts xviii. 7) 3 at Ephesus he preached in the
synagogue for three months before he withdrew to the school of
Tyrannus (ib. xix. 9). In our text it is plain that the writer supposes
the meeting-place mentioned to be open to non-Christians: sti-angers
might enter it either from curiosity, or from sympathy, or from
malice to spy out what was going on. St. Paul refers to such visits
from strangers 111 1 Cor. xiv. 23. But as it is called συναγωγὴν ὑ μ ὣ ν,
it is evidently assumed that it was mainly under Christian direction.
The precise circumstances would of course vary from town to town.

χρυσοδακτύλιος.] siff. λεγ. Lucian (Tim. 20) uses χρυσόχειρ in the same
sense, and Epict. Dz'ss. i. 22 speaks of γέρων χρυσοῦς δακτυλίους ἔχων
πολλούς, so Seneca ΝΩ. vii. 31 omm' articulo {semma exponitur, Plin.
NJJ. xxxiii. ch. 6, J uv. i. 28 : that the wearing of rings was customary
among the Jews appears from Luke XV. 22. Olem. Al. Paed. iii. p.
288 says that a man should only wear a ring on the little finger, and
that it should bear some religious emblem, dove, or fish, or anchor.
In Const. Apost. 1. 3 Christians are warned against fine clothing and
wearing of rings (μηδὲ χρυσήλατον σφενδόνην τοῖς δακτύλοις σου περιθῇς),
for these are all marks of wantonness. For ἀνήρ see above i. 8 n.

ἑν ἐσθῆτι λαμπρῷ] ἐν is classical in this use, like in in Latin. The
same epithet is used (Luke xxiii. 11) of the robe in which Herod clothed
J esus [should this be identified with the πορφυροῦν ἱμάτιον put on him
by the soldiers John xix. 2 2]‚ and of the angel (Acts x. 30), cf. Posidonius
ap. Athen. V. p. 212 (Ζ. of the upstart Athenio, who ἐξῄει χλαμύδα
λαμπρὰν ἐκσύρων καὶ περικείμενος δακτύλιον χρυσίου, Philo M. 2. p. 56
(Of Joseph) ἀντὶ ῥυπώσης λαμπρὰν ἐσθῆτα ἀντιδόντες, Artemid. ii. 3 fin.
ἀεὶ δὲ ἄμεινον καθαρὰ καὶ λαμπρὰ ἱμάτια ἔχειν καὶ πεπλυμένα καλῶς ἦ
ῥυπαρὰ καὶ ἄπλυτοι. There does not seem any reason to confine the
meaning to white colour as Thomas Magister and Casaubon on
Theophr. Char. 21. According to Wolf, the latter allows (in his
Emer-citt. c. Bar. xvi. 73, p. 532) that it may refer to any brilliant
colour, and so Salinas. on Tertull. Pall. p. 182. In Euseb. HE. ii. 10
a robe called λαμπρὰ καὶ βασιλική is afterwards described as στολὴ ἐξ
ἀργύρου πεποιημένη. Η616 the contrast with ῥυπαρά “’ soiled,' ‘ shabby,'
(see above i. 21 11.) would perhaps be most marked in the case of white,
which was also the usual colour worn by the Jews. Similar expressions
are ἱματισμὸς ἔνδοξος Luke vii. 25, Or πολυτελής 1 Tim. ii. 9.
