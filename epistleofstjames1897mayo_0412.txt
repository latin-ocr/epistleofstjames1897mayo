132 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

11101οΧ1, though not in the note⁷ of Oecumenius), and corrected into
φονεύετεῖ In 1 Pet. ii. 1 B has the same mistake, φόνους for φθόνους.
Α similar corruption may have given rise to the reading φθόνοι, φόνοι
111 Gal. v. 21. where φόνοι 15 omitted by the best MSS. Oonversely 111
Olem. Hom. ii. ll, φθόνου 15 wrongly given in 1110 MSS. for φόνου.
Certainly the process of thought is thus made easier. Accepting this
change of reading, we shall have only the last result, ‘ye fight and
war‚' following the two antecedents, ‘ye lust and have not,⁷ ‘ye are
envious and jealous and cannot obtain' : ‘ we thus see the words ἡδονῶν
στρατευομένων fitly associated With πόλεμοι καὶ μάχαι, and these words
anticipating μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε1 Hoskyns-Abrahall in GR. iii. p.
314). Internal unresb (ἡδοναὶ στρατευόμεναι ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν) in its two
stages—desire without possession (of a thing), envy and jealousy which
bring us 110 nearer our aim (of a person)-—is followed by outward dis-
turbance (μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε). Compare the stages of ἐπιθυμία in i. 14,
15. If it is once recognized that, whatever punctuation we adopt, φον-
εύετε can only be taken here 111 its literal sense, it must be allowed that it
disturbs the natural order, and snrikes, as it were, a false note between
the πόλεμοι and μάχαι Of ver. 1 ancl the μάχεσθε and πολεμεῖτε of V. 2.

ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ {xe-re] Both words ale used absolutely as in Rom.

emeat, Trench, Syn. p. Joo. Both are distinguished from ἐτι-ιθ. as
denoting a feeling towards a person rather than a thing. The word
ζῆλος with its cognates embraces the two meanings, emulation and
jealousy, and it 15 used also of vehement desire, our ‘ zeaL’ in a good
sense. For examples of the former meaning see Acts V. 17 and xiii.
45 ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου, Rom. xiii. 13, 1 Cor. iii. 3, 2 Cor. xii. 20, Gal. v.
20, and above iii. 14, in all which places the RV. has ‘jealousy'z
similarly the verb, Acts vii. 9 οἶ πατρίαρχαι ζηλώσαντες τὸν Ἰωσὴφ
ἀπέδοντο, ib. XVii. 5, ῙΟΟΓ. Χ111. 4, Clem. Rom. 11. 4 μὴ καταλαλεῖν
ἀλλήλων, μὴ ζηλοῦν. For ζῆλος 111 good sense cf. John ii. 17 ὁ ζῆλος τοῦ

(levour me,' Rom. X. 2 ζῆλον Θεοῦ ἔχουσιν, 2 Cor Xi. 2. ib. vii. 7 τὸν

ἀγαθόν Sir. li. 18, μὴ ζηλοῦτε θάνατον Wisd. i. 12. For the combination
