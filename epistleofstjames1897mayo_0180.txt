ihrem Recht gelangen'). The ‘ vain man' of v. ΞΟ is not Paul
(as Schwegler supposed, and as he must have been if J ames were
the author), but some one who claimed St. Paul's sanction for a
religion os barren orthodoxy.

I pause here for a moment to consider the very extraordinary
proceeding of the author whom Jiilicher has conjured up for us.
W⁷e are to suppose that he wishes to disabuse his neighbours of the
notion that St. Paul would have condoned their idle and vicious
lives on the ground that they were sound in their belief. If this
was the author-'s intention, surely he would have quoted such
passages as the chapter in praise of charity, or the list of the fruits
of the Spirit, or the moral precepts which abound in the Epistles,
rather than fiatly contradict St. Paul's language as to the justifying
power of saith. One can imagine with what just scorn Julicher
himself would have treated a makeshift theory of the kind, if it
had‘ been put forward in defence of Catholic, instead of Tffloingen,
tradition. But this is far from exhausting the self—eontradictions
involved in the supposition. Though the reason for postponing
the date of the Epistle is that the misunderstanding shown in it of
St. Paul's doctrine of saith and works is inconceivable at an earlier
period, yet we are now told that there was no real misunderstand—
ing in the mind of this late author ; he did not identify St. Paul’s
saith with the belief of devils, or his works of the law with the
fruits of saith. The only person who labours under the misunder-
standing is the ‘vain man' of v. 20.

The attempt to explain the seotion as a production of the an
century having failed, as I have tried to show, is it not better to
look at the matter from the other side, and see whether it may not
be more in accordance with the facts of the case to suppose J ames
to have written before Paul Ζ Neither Julieher nor Harnack will
listen to such a suggestion for a moment. The latter tells us that,
with the exception of a few critics whose assertions are every day
lesing ground (‘ mehr und mehr in Vergessenheit gerathen')‚ all
are now agreed that the Epistle does not belong to the Apostolic
age, The former calls it ridieulous (‘komisch') to dream of its
being written in 30 or 40 ΑΛ). Such fiowers of speech need not
detain us : like the anathemes of earlier times, they are the
natural weapons of those who wish to strengthen a weak cause by
the intimidation of adversaries. I must, however, express my
regret that Harnack should have spoken in such slighting terms of
