c xviii INTRODUCTION

If further proof were needed to show that the persecutors
referred to by St. James were wealthy Jews and not Gentiles, it
might be found in the absence of all allusion to Gentiles in our
Epistle. Nothing is said as to hardships suffered from them,
nothing as to the duty of evangelizing them, or as to the con-
ditions under which they should be received into the Church,
nothing as to difficulties of social intercourse, eg. as regards
eating or marriage. There is no reference to that which was the
burning question at the Counci] of Jerusalem (A.D. 51) and on the
occasion of St. Paul's later visit to Jerusalem (A.D. 58), viz, the
necessity of the rite of circumcision (Acts XV„ xxi. 21—25>, a
question which occupies such an important place in the Epistles to
the Galatians and the Romans. It is inconceivable that, if the
question were one about which difficulties were generally felt or
which was giving rise to practical complications at the time, it
could have been passed over in a circular letter addressed to
Jewish residents in Gentile lands, especially as the writer inad-
vertently uses language which, though not itself bearing on this
subject, might seem at first sight to have a reference to St. Paul's
argument, that circumcision is unnecessary because saith in Christ
is the sole means of justification. We may therefore conclude
with considerable probability that it had not yet become a matter
of pressing importance. If we compare the First Epistle of St.
Peter we find a different state of things3 the Gentiles are there
distinctly alluded to, as making false charges against the Christians
(ii. 12), who are exhorted to submit to the constituted civil
authorities and silence their gainsayers by their good behaviour (ii.
13—15). It is further stated that some of the Christians had
joined in the immoralities of the Gentiles in their unconverted
days, and had subsequently incurred their displeasure by the
change in their way of life (iv. 3, 4).

As to the faults of the Christians, the tone of St. J ames is much
more severe than that of St. Peter in his First Epistle, but so far
as the latter does specify any charge, it is that of impatience,
murmuring, evil-speaking, to which we find many parallels in the
plainer spoken Epistle of St. James. St. Paul, as we have seen, in
his Epistles to the Galatians and Romans lays stress mainly on the
temptation which beset the Jews to substitute legal righteousness,
the performance of the works of the law with all its slavish
scrupulosity, for the righteousness which is by faith in Christ3 but
