is not logically exact (cf. above i. 17 πᾶσα, and 25 ποιητὴς ἔργου) : either

Heb. vi. 12, pp. 167ff.‚ where after tracing the 1130 of the word
κληρόνομος 111 the O.T. he says that in ‘ the Nsr. the word is commonly
used in connexion with the blessing (1 Pet. iii. 9) which belongs to
divine sonship‚ the spiritual correlative to the promise to Abraham
(Rom. iv. 13f.; viii. 17, Gal. iii. 18, 29, iv. 1, 7, Heb. vi. 12, 17,
xi. 8). The son of God, as son, enjoys that which answers to his new
birth (cf. Mam. v. 5, Eph. i. 14, 18, Col. iii. 24). This is described as
“eternal life⁷' (Matt. xix. 29 , Tit. iii. 17, comp. Mark X. 17, Luke x. 25,
xviii. 18), or “the kingdom of G0sl⁷' (1 Cor. vi. 9f. 3 xv, 50, Gal. V. 21 ,
comp. Matt. xxv, 343 Eph. v. 5), or “salvation'' (Heb. i. 14), an

Also p. 483, ‘the heirship of man to the Divine blessing answering
to his nature is founded on God's purpose in creation, on the gift of
His image with the power of attaining to His likeness⁷

words are used of the crown. For atti-action cf. 1 John iii. 24 ἐκ τοῦ
πνεύματος οὗ ἔδωκεν, Winer p. 203. In the Psalms ‘ the poor' is almost
equivalent to ‘the godly'3 with the same feeling the Jewish Christians
took the name ‘Ebionitesj

(1) as impiety, contravening the pmpose of God, who has selected
the poor as special objects of0 His 1ονος (2) as injustice and want of
