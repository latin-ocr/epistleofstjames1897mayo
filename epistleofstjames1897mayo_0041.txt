THE AUTHOR xxi

Alphaeus‚ The comparative minor, he says, suggests two persons,
viz, the two Apostles of this name. But the Greek has no com-
parative, simply τοῦ μικροῦ, ‘ the little,’ which no more implies a
comparison with only one person, than any other descriptive
epithet, such as εὐεργέτης or φιλάδελφος. Α5 to Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου,
110 instance is cited sor such an omission of the word ἁδελφός, and
we must therefore translate ‘Judas son of James' with the RV.
Independently of this, if James, Judas and Simon arc all sons of
Alphaeus‚ what a strange way is this of introducing their names in
the list of the Apostles, ‘J ames of Alphaeus‚ Simon Zelotes, J udas
of James' 1 Why not speak of all as ‘ sons of Alphaeus‚’ or of the
two latter as ‘ brothers of J ames ' 2 Why not speak of all as
‘brethren of the Lord'? It is especially strange that, if Judas
were really known as such, he should have been distinguished in
John (xiv. 22> merely by a negative, ‘Judas not Isca1·iot,' and in
the other Gospels by the appellation ‘ Lebbaeus ' or ‘ Thaddaeus'
(Matt. x. 3, Mark iii. 18).
(6) Much has been made of the identification of the names There is 110

ground for

Alphaeus and Clopas, and of the duality of Glopas and Cleopas mentm-mg

(Luke xxiv, 18). It seems doubtful whether the identification of cfflffis

the former and the separation of the latter pair can be maintained. Alphaeus'
Bp. Lightfoot considers that ⁶ viewing the question as one of names

only, it is quite as reasonable to identify Clopas with Cleopas as

with Alphaeus’ (Le. pp. 256, 267). Supposing, however, our pre-

vious argument to be sound‚ the question is of no importance as to

our main subject.

I have endeavoured to point out the difficulties which beset the Ezprgpffljgn-
Hieronymian theory and make it in my opinion less worthy of ἒξεῗπῆἐγ
acceptance than either of the other theories. As it seems still to 111iize1i‘iri33w.

1 Even a commentator so little settered by tradition as Dr. S. Cox writes thus in
the Eoepositor for ,J an. 1890, p. 68 : ‘ J ames then (as 1 hold and shall assume, after a
careful study of the various theories propounded about him...) was the son of
Alphaeus‚ otherwise called Clopas, and of his wife, the sister of the Virgin Mary...
Among his brothers were Simeon...Jude...Joses...and Levi the publican.' It is
curious that the one authority to which Dr. Cox refers those who care to examine the
controversy for themselves is ‘the admirable summary in Dean Plumptre's commen-
tary‚' where, however, we read (p. 17> ‘ there is absolutely no ground for identifying
the brother of the Lord with the son of Alphaeus.'
