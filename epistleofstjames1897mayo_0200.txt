clxxx IN TRODUCTION

v for «yv is constant in the N. T. in «γίνομαι and «γινώσκω,
According to Meisterhans‚ Gr. d. Att. Insclw'. p. 141, *γίγνομαι 15 the
reading of the Attio inscriptions without exception up to 292 B.C.‚
and «γίνομαι, equally without exception, between 290 and 30 ΒΟ.

Vowels.

ι for ει 111 abstract substantives: see Hort aa. p. 153, and
compare ἐριθία(ἲ) James iii. 16, ἀλαζονίαις iv. 16, κακοπαθίας
v. 103 but περισσείαν i. 21, θρησκεία 1. 27 (ἐθελοθρησκία
Col. ii. 23).

πρόϊμος for πρώιμος (v. 7), for which Hort compares χρεοφειλέ-
της, Στοῑκός.

πραΰτης for the classical πραότης i. 21; the forms πραΰς and
πρᾶος 316 both Classical, the former being preferred in the feminine
and generally in the oblique cases.

Hiatus.

Hiatus is not shunned by the Hellenistic, as it is by the later
Attic writers. Thus in i. 4 it occurs six times, and elision is pro—
portionably rare, the only words elided in our Epistle being ἀλλά
111 11. 18 ἀλλ’ ἐρεῖ τις (but ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν i. 26, ἀλλὰ, ἐπίγειος
111. 15), ἐπί 111 ii. 7 ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, v. 7 ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, and v. 14 ἐπ’ αὐτόν;
ἀπό 111 ἀφ’ ὑμῶν iv. 7, v, 53 παρά in παρ’ ᾧ i. 173 κατά 111 καθ’
ἑαυτήν ii. 17, καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν iii. 9, κατ’ ἀλλήλων V. 9. On the
other hand we have ὑπό unelicled 111 iii. 4 ὑπὸ ἐλαχίστου; 111 fact-
the only word which is uniformly elided in the ΘΤ. 15 παρά,
but the word is comparatively rare, and does not occur before a
proper name beginning with a vowel. Of unelided κατά we find
instances in Acts 111. 17 κατὰ ἄγνοιαν, ib. xxii. 3 κατὰ ἀκρίβειαν,
Rom. ii. 2 κατὰ ἀλήθειαν, ih. iii. 5, 1 Cor. iii. 3, ix. 8, XV. 32 κατὰ
ἄνθρωπον, Rom. xiv. 15 κατὰ ἀτγάπην &Q Unelided ἐπί is found
111 Luke iii. 2 ἐπὶ Ἰωάννην, il). V. 36 ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον, ib. xi. 17 ἐπὶ οἶκον,
ib. xxi. 10 ἐπὶ ἔθνος &c.; unelided ἀπό 111 Luke viii. 43 ἀπὸ ἐτῶν,
ι’ὒ. Χ111. 21 ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, ib. xvi. 18 ἀπὸ ἀνδρός ; unelided ὑπό 111
Luke vii. 27 ὑπὸ ἀνέμου, ib. XXi. 24 ὑπὸ ἐθνῶν δῖε. Unelided διά
15 found in Heb. v. 14 διὰ ἕξιν, 2 Cor. V. 7 διὰ εἴδους and before
proper names. In general we may say that elision takes place
before a pronoun, or 3 word with which the preposition is habitually
joined, but not before a proper name, 01 a word which it is
important to make distinct.
