60 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMEs

Psa. vii. 14 quoted on v. 15 above, and with the 1156 01 ὠδίνειν Gal. iv..
19 ; also with Psa. xc. 2 (where the Heb. word translated ‘ thou hadst
formed ' means primarily ‘ to be in pangs with child,’ ⁴ to bear a child,⁷
Jennings ‘in loc.) and Psa. xxii. 9, Clem. Hom. ii. 52 Ἀδὰμ ὂ ὑπὸ τῶν
τοῦ Θεοῦ χειρῶν κυοφορηθείς. On the word ἀπεκύησεν see V. 15. On the
beneficence of the Divine Will 61. Philo M. 1. p. 342 καθ’ ὃ μὲν οὖν·
ἅρχων ἐστίν, ἄμφω δύναται καὶ εῧ καὶ κακῶς ποιεῖν...καθ’ ὃ δὲ εὐεργέτης,
θάτερον μόνον βούλεται, τὸ εὐεργετεῖν, man’s greatest blessing is to have
the firm hope which springs from the consoiousness of the leving will
Of God (ἐκ τοῦ προαιρετικῶς εἶναι φιλόδωρον), ib. M. 2. p: 367, 437
βουληθεὶς ὃ Θεὸς διὰ ἡμερότητα καὶ φιλανθρωπίαν παρ’ ἡμῖν τοῦθ’ ἱδρύσασ-
θαι κ.τ.λ., Clem. Al. Paed. i. 6. p. 114 P ὡς γὰρ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ (his
absolute Will)l ἔργον ἐστι’, καὶ τοῦτο κόσμος ὀνομάζεται, οὕτως καὶ τὸ
βούλημα αὐτοῦ (1115 desire) ἀνθρώπων ἐστὶ σωτηρία, καὶ τοῦτο ἐκκλησία
καλεῖται, ib. Strom. Vii p. 855 P. οὔτε γὰρ ὃ Θεὸς ἄκων ἀγαθός, ὃν τρόπον
τὸ πῦρ θερμαντικόν, ἑκούσιος δὲ ἡ τῶν ἀγαθῶν μετάδοσις αὐτῷ, Plato Tim.
29 (on the cause Of creation) λέγωμεν δι’ ἥντινα αἰτίαν γένεσιν καὶ τὸ πᾶν
τόδε ὃ ξυνιστὰς ξυνέστησεν. ἀγαθὸς ἣν, ἀγαθῷ δὲ οὐδεὶς περὶ οὐδενὸς
οὐδέποτε ἐγγίγνεται φθόνος.

λόγῳ ἀληθείας] The word (explained in the parallel passage, 1 Pet.
i. 25, to be τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν εἷς ὑμᾶς, as in Rom. X. 8, 17) 15 God’s
instrument for communicating the new life: see below v, 21 λόγος
ἔμφυτος, Matt. iv. 4, John Vi. 63 τὰ ῥήματα ἂ ἐγὼ λελάληκα ὑμῖν πνεῦμά
ἐστιν καὶ ζωή ἐστιν, XVii. 7, 8, Rom. X. 17, 1 Pet. 1. 23. The phrase*
occurs Psa. cxix. 43 (cf. Eccl. xii. 10), Eph. i. 13 ἀκούσαντες τὸν λόγον τῆς
ἀληθείας, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς σωτηρίας ὑμῶν...ἐσφραγισθητε τῷ πνεύματι,
2 Cor. vi. 7 (approving ourselves as ministers of God) ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας,
ἐν δυνάμει θεοῦ, 2 Tim. ii. 15 (Timothy is urged to show himself a
workman rightly dividing) τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας, Col. i. 5 (the hope
which you had) ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, cf. Westcott on
1 ,1011. i. 1. περὶ τοῦ λόγου τῆς ζωῆς. Alf„ following Wiesinger, calls
ἀληθείας a gen. 01 apposition‚ comparing «1011. xvii. 17 ‘thy word is
truth ⁷ 3 why not objective‚ ‘ the declaration 01 1116 truth, viz. 01 God's
love revealed in the life, death, and resurrection 01 Jesus Christ '2 cf.
below v. 19, and Westcott on Heb. x. 26? see also John viii. 31, 32
‘if ye continue in my word ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free.' For the omission 01 the article With abstract
words cf. Phil. ii. 16 λόγον ζωῆς ἐπέχοντες, Gal. V. 5 ἡμεῖς γὰρ πνεύματι
ἐκ πίστεως ἐλπίδα δικαιοσύνης ἀπεκδεχόμεθα, below ver. 22 ποιηταὶ λόγου,
iv, 11 νόμον, and 566 Essay on Grammar and Winer p. 198 1011. 11 15

¹ Bp. Westcott (Heb. vi. 17) says that ‘as distinguished from Θέλειν, βούλεσθαι
regards apurpose with reward to somethingglge, while θέλειν regards the feeling in
respect to the person hnnself.' Ι should rather be disposed to say that the element
of thought and desire 15 inore prominent in βούλεσθαι, the element of pure volition
(determination) in θέλειν, cf. below ἐὰν ὁ Κύριος θελήσῃ with the quotation from
Plato Alczb. i. The distinction is of course liable to get blurred by such figurative
uses as we have in iii. 4 ὅπου ἡ ὁρμὴ βούλεται.

² [I should prefer to take it as a possessive genitive ‘ words belonging to truth‚’
as <dn 1 Cor. ii. 4, 18) σοφίας λόγοι ‘words belonging to wisdom' or ‘uttered by
wis om.' A.]
