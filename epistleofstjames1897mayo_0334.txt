disease, but also in the deterioration of mind and character which
accompanies every kind of sin, till the man is said to be νεκρὸς τοῖς
παραπτώμασιν (Eph. 11. l). ”

16. μὴ πλανᾶσθε ἀδελφοί pou] ‘ Be not mistaken : not temptation but
all that 15 good comes from God.’ Cf. Matt. xxii. 29 πλανᾶσθε μὴ εἰδότες
τὰς γραφάς, Luke xxi. S βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε. St. Paul uses the
phrase μὴ πλανᾶσθε, 1 Cor. vi. 9, xv, 33, Gal. vi. 7. Here its
earnestness is softened by the addition ἀδελφοί as in Ignat. Philad, 3,
E alc. 16.

217, πᾶσα, δόσις ἀγαθὴ καὶ πᾶν δώρημα τέλειον.] ‘ All good giving and
every perfect gift' (descend from Him who gives to all liberaliy).
The stress is laid on ἀγαθή and τέλειον. Beyschlag and Erdmann
with others have assigned to πᾶσα the same meaning as it bore
in v, 2, but this use is rai-ely found except in reference to abstract
qualities, not to acts or things. No doubt such a rendering would
give a more exact logical contradiction. ‘ All good comes from God '
does not necessarily exclude the possibility of evil also coming from
Him. But practically the opposition is sufficient, ‘God does not
tempt to evil: it is good, good of every kind, which comes from
Him' 3 and if we are right in supposing the verse to be a quotation,
there is the less reason to ask for an exact logical antithesis (cf.
below, ii. 5). For the thought see Plato Rep. ii. 379 οὐδ’ ἄρα ὁ

It will be observed that the words make a hexameter line, with a
short syllable lengthened by the metrical stress. I think Ewald is right
in considering it to be a quotation from some Hellenistic poem. Spitta
suggests that it may be taken from the Sibylline books, see below on
iii. S. The authority of a familiar line would add persuasion to the
writer's words, and account for the somewhat subtle distinction between
δοσ. ἀγ. and ὃω. τελ. Other examples of verse quotations in the N.T.
are Tit. i. 12 Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται κακὰ θηρία γαστέρες ἀργαί, 1 Cor. XV. 33
φθείρουσιν ἤθη χρῆσθ’ ὁμιλίαι κακαί, Which follows a μὴ πλανᾶσθε, ashere,
without any mark of quotation, Acts xvii. 28 τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν.
More doubtful examples are John iV. 35 οὐχ ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι ἔτι ίτετροὶ-
μηνός ἐστι καὶ ὂ (χώ) θερισμὸς ἔρχεται] Heb. Xii. 13 καὶ τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς
ποιήσατε (al. ποιεῖτε) τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν, where the source of the quotation
(Prov. iV. 26 ὀρθὰς τροχιὰς ποίει τοῖς ποσίν) seems to have been altered
for the purpose of versification. Dr. E. L. Hicks considers that
