tone of our Epistle and may help to explain the reserve with which
distinctive Christian doctrines are treated in it. Is it going too far
to compare the use of ἁγνίζω 111 Acts xxi. 24 and 5 ames iv. 8, and
the construction of δαπανᾶν 111 the same verse (δαπάνησον ἐπ’
αὐτοῖς) and in James iv. 3 ἵνα ἐν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς ὑμῶν δαπανήσητεῖ

The only other passage in which 5311163 13 mentioned by name
in the Epistles is 1 Cor. xv. 7, where we are told that Jesus
appeared to James after his Resurrection. Of this more will be
said shortly. But we have seen that in Gal. i. 10 he receives the
appellation of ‘ the Lord's brother,' and there are further allusions
to the ‘brethren of the Lord ’ in 1 Cor. ix. 5, which is generally
taken to imply that they were all married, and in Acts i. 14, where
we are told that after the Ascension ‘the Eleven with the women
and Mary the mother of 563113 and his brethren remained together
at Jerusalem waiting for the promise of the spirit? These passages
also will come 111 for further consider ation immediately.

An objection may be raised to the identification of the writer ofR tbi} 01111111

claim is made to this title in either of the Epistles which go by the
names of the brothers 5 ames and J ude. If they were really
brothers of the Lord, would they not have laid stress on the
authority derived from this relationship‚ just as St. Paul lays stress
on his apostleship? But what was Christ’s own teaching on the
matter? When his mother and brothels sought on one occasion
to use the authority, which they assumed that their kinship gave
them, they were met by the w ords‘ Who 13 my mother, and t§who
are my brethren2’ And he stretched out his hand to his disciples
and said ‘ Behold my mother and my brethren.' St. Paul expresses
the same idea, of the disappearance of the earthly relationship in
the higher spiritual union‚ by which all the members of the body
are joined to the Head, in the words ‘though we have known
Christ after the flesh, yet now know we him so no more,' 2 Cor. v,
16. Surely it is only what we should have expected beforehand‚
that James and Jude would shrink from claiming another name
than that of ‘ servant ' to express the relation in which they stood
‘to their risen Lord, after having failed (as I shall shortly endeavour
to show) to acknowledge Him 33 their Master in the days of his
humiliation.

So far we have arrived at the following conclusions: the writer
