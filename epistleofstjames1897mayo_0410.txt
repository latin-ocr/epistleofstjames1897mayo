130 ΤΗΕ EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

2. ἐπιθυμεῖτε καὶ οὐκ ἔχετε· ῲονεῦετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε, καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν.
μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε] This is the reading and punctuation of VVestcott
and Hort, agreeing in essentials with Alford, Tischendorf and the more
recent editors. The RV. has ‘ ye lust, and have not ε ye kill, and covet
(marg. ‘are jealous ')‚ and cannot obtain : ye fight and warz' The
extraordinary anti-climax ‘ye kill and covet’ has long exercised the
minds of commentators, who have endeavoured to remove it either
(1) by weakening the force of φονεύετε, or (2) by strengthening the
force of ζηλοῦτε, or (3) by giving a special meaning to the connexion
between them.

(1, α) ‘ Kill ¹ means ‘ hate‚' because every one that hateth his brother
is a murderer. 80 Estius, Corn. a Lap., Theile, De watto, XViesinger,
Beyschlag, Erdmann. (1, h) ⁴ Kill ¹ means ‘ commit moral suicide,’ so
oecumenius and Theophylact, φονεύειν φησὶ τοὺς τὴν ἑαυτῶν ψυχὴν ἀπο-
κτιννύντας ταῖς τοιαύταις ἐπιχειρήσεσι.

(2) ζηλοῦτε means ‘ become ζηλωταί,’ z'.e. assassins 3 so Macknight and
Dean Scoft in the Speaker's Commentargy, referring to Josepl1us,B..J
vii. 8,1‚whe1e the ζηλωταί aie said to hav e been 1101 e th: ’111 the σικάριοι.

(3) φονεύετε καὶ ζηλοῦτε f01 m a hendiadysst ye mur (101 ous ly envy, 'ad
necem usque invidens. So Potnsehneekenburgffl,Gebse13a11d not
much othei wise Bengel, occiditis per odza et zelum.

The objections to these expedients are to my mind conclusive. (1) It
does not follow, because to show the heinousness of hate it may be repre-
sented as virtually equivalent to the murder of which it is the germ, that
it is therefore allowable in all cases to substitute the word ‘ murder ' for
‘ hate.’ Iu the present case it may be safely said that no sane writer,
no 0110 who had the slightest feeling for rhetorical effect (and St. James
is both eminently sane and einiuently rhetorical) could have used
φονεύετε 111 the sense of μισεῖτε before ζηλοῦτε. There is no reason here
to lay an exaggerated stress on the idea of hate, if nothing more than
hate is intended : not only does it make a mere bathos of ζηλοῦτε, but
it weakens the force of the following μάχεσθε καὶ πολεμεῖτε. Others
have thought it impossible that those addressed by St. James could
be guilty of the actual sin of murder. But in ch. v. 6 we read ἐφονεύ-
σατε τὸν δίκαιον, SO l Pet. iV. 15 μὴ γάρ τις ὑμῶν πασχέτω ὡς φονεὺς ἦ
κλέπτης ἢ κακοποιός, and Didache iii. 2 μὴ γίνου ὀργίλος...μηδὲ ζηλωτὴς
μηδὲ ἐριστικὸς μηδὲ θυμικός· ἐκ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων φόνοι γειηννῶνται, and
I think we should gather from Acts xxi. 20 that some of the assailants
of St. Paul at Jerusalem were members of the Christian community.
Of (2) it is sufficient to say that there is no evidence of the verb ζηλόω
being used in this sense, and nothing to suggest it 111 the GT. use of
the word ζηλωτής. (3) If ζηλοῦτε preceded φονεύετε, something might
be said for the theory of ἓν διὰ δυοῖν; as it is, every 0110 must feel
that it is a suggestion of despair.

Lastly‚ Alford, Bouma11‚sel1egg and others, feeling the unsatisfactory
natuie of the above— mentioned expl mations, have 1111011 back on the
liteial iendeiing. Scheg< gis the only commentatm known to 1110 who
makes any attempt to account for the oidei of the words, which he
defends as fel1ows: ‘Die Lust heyam-et, d. h. sie sucht werkth'atig zu
