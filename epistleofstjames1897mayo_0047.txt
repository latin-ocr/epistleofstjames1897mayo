this may be, in any case, as her Son's dearest friend, he must have
been well known to her. And if we try to picture to ourselves
the circumstances of the case, it is not difficult to imagine contin-
gencies which would make it a very natural arrangement. It is
generally supposed (from 1 Cor. ix. 5) that the brothers of the Lord
were married men: the usual age for marriage among the Jews was
about eighteen: supposing them to have been born before the visit
to the Temple of the child J esus, they would probably have married
before his Crucifixion. If then all her children were disper-sed in
their several homes, and if, as we naturally infer, her nephew John
was unmarried and living in a house of his own, is there anything
unaccountable in the Lord's mother finding a horne with the
beloved disciple2 Could this be regarded in any way as a slight
by her other sons? Must they not have felt that the busy life of
a family was not suited for the quiet pondering which now more
than ever would characterize their mother'.l and further that this
communion between the Mother and the Disciple was likely to be
not only a source of comfort to both, but also most profitable to

age does not count for much. It might however be thought that
those who had grown up with one like J esus, must have felt such
love and reverence for him, that they could never dream of blaming
or criticizing what he thought best to do. Yet we know that his
mother, to whom had been vouchsafed a much fuller revelation
than was possible in their case, as to the true nature of her Son,
did nevertheless on more than one occasion draw upon herself his
reproof for ventured interference. If we remember how little even
those whom he chose out as his Apostles were able to appreciate
his aims and methods up to the very end of his life, how different
was their idea of the Kingdom of Heaven and the office of the
Messiah from His, we shall not wonder if his younger brothers,
with all their admiration for his genius and goodness, were at times
puzzled and bewildered at the words that fell from his lips; if they
regarded him as a self-forgetting idealist and enthusiast, wanting

in knowledge of the world as it was, and needing the constant care
