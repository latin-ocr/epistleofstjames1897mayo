V 18-20] NOTES 179

τῶν χειρῶν σου δώσειςῙ λύτρωσιν ἁμαρτιῶν σου, Constit. Apost. vii. 12
δός, ἵνα ἐργάσῃ εἷς λύτρωσιν ἁμαρτιῶν σου· ἐλεημοσύναις γὰρ καὶ πίστεσιν
ἀποκαθαίρονται ἁμαρτίαι, so Barn. xix. 10. Luke xvi. 9 is naturally
understood in the same sense. Similarly Olem. R. ii. 16 καλὸν ἐλεη-
μοσύνη ὡς μετάνοια ἁμαρτίας· κρείσσων νηστεία προσευχῆς, ἐλεημοσύνη δὲ
ἀμφοτέρων, then he quotes the verse from St. Peter, and continues
ἐλεημοσύνη γὰρ κούφισμα ἁμαρτίας γίνεται, Which leaves no doubt as to
the way in which he understood it.2 Bp. Lightfoot in his note says
‘in James v. 20 the expression seems still to be used of the sins of
others, but in the sense of burying them from the sight of God,
wiping them out by the repentance of the sinner.' He however cites
Tertull. Scorp. 6 as understanding the words to mean ‘atones for a
multitude of one's own sins': so too Clem. Al. Quis div. sal. ξ 38,
p. 956 ἐὰν ταύτην (τὴν ἀγάπην) ἐμβάληταί τις τῇ ψυχῇ, δύναται, κᾶν ἐν ἆμαρ-
τήμασιν ᾗ γεγεννημένος κᾶν πολλὰ τῶν κεκωλυμένων εἰργασμένος, αὐξήσας
τὴν ἀγάπην καὶ μετάνοιαν καθαρὰν λαβών, ἀναμαχέσασθαι τὰ ἐπταισμένα,
ib. Sto-om. i. p. 4233 in Strom. ii. p. 463 ἀγάπη is understood of God’s
forgiving love. There is a remarkable passage of Origen (Hom. in Lev.
ii. ξ 4), in which the different remissiones peccatorum in the Gospel are
enumerated: (l) baptism, (2) martyrdom, (3) almsgiving (which he
supports by Luke xi. 41), (4) forgiveness of others (supported by Matt.
vi. 14), (5) converting a sinner, ita enim dicit scriptura divina, quia
qui converti fecerit peccatorem ab errore viae suem salvat aazimamss ιι
morte et cooperit multitudinem peccatorm›z‚4 (6) love (supported by Luke
vii. 47 and l Pet. iv. 8) 3 and much in the same way Cassian (Coll. XX.
8) enumerating the various ways in which sin may be vblotted out,
besides simple penitence, mentions the conversion of others by our
exhortations.

It appears to me that these passages leave little doubt that
Jewish writers generally and some Christian writers thought that one
who had brought about the conversion of another had thereby secured
his own salvation : if we further consider the use of the future tense
(σώσει, καλύψει) touched on in the previous note, and the fact that, if
the saving of the soul and the hiding of sins have reference to the
sinner, they do not essentially differ from what is already involved in
the protasis, which states the conversion of the sinner from the error
of his way, it might seem that we ought to interpret the verse as
Origen does in the passage just quoted. So Euth. Zig. 'and Oramer's
Centena (in loc.) τοιοῦτον τὸ ἐν τῷ Ἱερεμίᾳ εἰρημένον, (καὶ ἐὰν ἐξαγάγῃς
τίμιον ἀπὸ ἀναξίου ὡς στόμα μου ἔση·’ ἐάν, φησιν, εἷς τῶν ἀπολλυμένων
διὰ τὴν κακίαν εὐτελῶν σωθῇ διὰ τῶν σῶν λόγων, ἔντιμος ἔσῃ διὰ τοῦτο
παρ’ ἐμοί. We may also compare Dan. xii. 3 ‘they that be wise
shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that

¹ Dr. Abbott suggests δὸς εἷς as in the following quotation from Const. Apost.

2 Compare Taylor, Jewish Fathers, p. 27.

³ So Cod. Sangerm.; libri editi add ejus.

4 This is repeated further on with allusion to the Levitical offering of doves: Si
meditando sicut columba...ab erroro suo converteris peccatorem et abjecta nequitia ad
simplicitatem eum columbae revocaveris...cluos pullos columbarum Domino obtulisti.
