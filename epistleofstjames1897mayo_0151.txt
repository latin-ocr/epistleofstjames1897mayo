ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE cxxxi

Dr. Davidson goes on to deny the authenticity of the Epistle on
the ground (1) that the acquaintance which it shows with St. Paul’s
Epistles, especially those to the Romans and Galatians, and, above
all, its polemio aspect towards the doctrine of ι11131111001100 by faith
alone, assign it to a post-apostolic period. [This argument has, of
course, no weight with those who consider that this Epistle was
written before those of St. Paul, and who do not therefore recog-
nize any polemic aspect towards St. Paul's doctrine. 1 have
shown, in ch. iv., that St. J ames is attacking that most ancient of
all religious heresies, which puts words and professions in the
place of deeds and conduct] (2) ‘The style of writing is too
good for James.‘ Something has been said on this point already
in pp. xli. and xlii„ and more will be said shortly in the chapter
on the Language of the Epistle. (3) ‘ It is not likely that
J 011103, the Lord's brother, would have directly opposed Paul⁷s
doctrine...That he should have written against it argues a want of
respect for the Apostle of the Gentiles incompatible with James⁷s
position.’ Quite true ; but of no force against those who deny the
polemio aspect. (401 ‘The essential doctrines of Christianity are
wanting in the Epistle...Had J ames written it, we should naturally
vexpect some mention of Christ's resurrection at least...On the
other hand, the Mosaic law, circumcision, &c., are passed over, and
the royal law of liberty is exalted. . ‚The writer had therefore attained
to a subjective standpoint beyond J ames ; 10 ideas of Christian
liberty like the Pauline...A]though the statement of Christian
doctrines is incomplete as well as imperfect, and the writer's point
of view more Jewish than Christian, he occupies a spiritual stage
in Jewish Christ-ianity which J ames the Just scarcely reached? It
might be well if the writer of these confused and sels-contradictory
sentences would take the trouble carefully to compare the teaching
of the Sermon on the Mount with that of St. J ames, and consider
how far his remarks are applicable to the former. (5) ‘ The letter
is professedly addressed to all J ewish-Christians out of Palestine.
But were there churches composed of such members2...Churches
were of a mixed character except in Palestine, Wiesinger there—
fore may well ask, Where shall we look for the J ewish-Christians
out of Palestine which will satisfy the requirements of 1110 Epistle 2-
a question not answered by reference to Acts ii. 5-11, xi. 91, Sec„

1 This argument has disappeared from the last edition (1894), but 1 have allowed
my remarks to stand, as the general thread of the discussion seems to 1110 10 110 still
marked by the same inconsistency as that on which I have commented above.
