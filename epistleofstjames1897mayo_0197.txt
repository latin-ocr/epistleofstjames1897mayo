SPITTA ΟΝ THE DATE OF THE EPISTLE clxxvii

less strong a proof of a contemporary belief in such miracles, than
are St. Paul’s directions about the gift of tongues and prophecy‚ as
to the existence of those phenomena in his day.

I have argued above, p. iii. foll„ that the Epistle must have been
written by St. J ames, (l) because of the resemblance which it
bears to the speeches and circular of St. James recorded in the
Acts 3 (2) because it exactly suits all that we know of him. It was
his office to interpret Christianity to the Jews. He is the authority
whom St. Paul’s opponents profess to follow, Tradition even goes
so far as to represent the unbelieving Jews as still doubting, at the
end of his life, whether they might not look to him for a declara-
tion against Christianity.l (3) The extraordinary resemblance
between our Epistle and the Sermon on the Mount and other dis-
courses of Jesus is most easily aecounted for, if we suppose it to
have been written by the brother of the Lord (above, p. xli. foll).
Spitta labours to show that this resemblance is due to the fact that
both borrow from older Jewish writings. Even if this were so, it
would be far more probable that one of the two bon-owed indirectly
through the other, than that they should both have chanced to
collect, each for himself, the same sayings from a variety of obscure
sources. But it is mere perversity to put forward such vague
parallels as are adduced from rabbinical writings on the subject of
oaths, for instance, or the perishable treasures of earth, by way of
accounting for the exact resemblance existing between J ames v. 12
and Matthew V. 34-37‚ J ames V. 2, 3 and Matthew vi. 19.

As to the warning against oaths, Spitta has nothing to appeal to
beyond the very general language of Ecclesiastes ix, 2, Sirac. xxiii.
9-11, Philo M. 2, p. 194, in contrast to the literal agreement of
J ames, ‘ Above all things swear not, neither by the heaven, neither
by the earth, neither by any other oath3 but let your yea be yea,
and your nay nay, lest ye fall into condemnation‚⁷ and Matthew,
‘ Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is ch's throne3 nor by
the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the
city of the great king: neither shalt thou swear by thy head,
because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let
your communication be Yea, yea3 Nay, nay; for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.' He suggests, however, that
possibly the latter passage was not really spoken by Christ at all,
since He did not act upon it when adjured by the chief priest: it
