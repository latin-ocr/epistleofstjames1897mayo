SPITTA ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE OF THE EPISTLE clxxv

latter speaks as he is moved by the Spirit of God. That, after all,
is the broad distinction between our Epistle and all uninspired
writing: it carries with it the impress of one who had passed
through the greatest of all experiences, who had seen with his eyes
that Eternal Life which was with the Father and was manifeste‹l
to the Apostles.

I proceed now to consider the remaining arguments adduced by
Massebieau‚ after which I shall mention some points in the Epistlc
which seem to be irreconcilable with J ewish authorship, and shall
then go on to examine some of the parallels offered by Spitta.

Massebieau thinks that, if St. J ames were a Christian, he could
not have failed to make a more marked distinction between what
he speaks from himself and what he takes from the Gospels. I
think the reason why he has not done so is that, while, like a good
stewarcl, he brings out things new and old from his treasury, he
feels that all is given to him from above : the new, as well as the
old, is the teaching of Christ. As to the supposed contradiction
between the language of St. J ames and that of Christ in regard to
loving our enemies‚ it is enough to refer to the many warnings
against anger (i. 19), quarrelling (iii. 9, iv. 1, 2), and murmuring (v.
8, 9), and to the praise of gentleness, humility, and a peaceable spirit
(i. 21, iii. 17, iv. 6). Even where he reminds his readers that the rich
deserve no favour at their hands, he is careful to add at once, ‘ If
you show favour to them because you remember the royal law,
which bids us love our neighbour as ourselves‚ then you are right 3
but if it is mere respect of persons, you transgress the law.’ As to
the coming Judge‚ any apparent contradiction is explained by St.
Paul's language (Acts xvii. 31), ‘God hath appointed a day 111
which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom
He hath ordained.'

Among things which seem to be incompatible with J ewish
authorship may be mentioned the use of the phrase ἀδελφοί μου
ἀγαπητοί which occurs three times (i. 16, 19, ii. 5) and is very
natural as an expression of the strong φιλαδελφία which united
the early disciples. Spitta only cites examples of the formal
ἀδελφοί. His attempt to explain away the Christian motive of i.
18 seems to me equally unsuccessful. We read there βουληθεὶς
ἀπεκύησεν ἡμᾶς λόγῳ ἀληθείας εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἀπαρχήν τινα
τῶν αὐτοῦ κτισμάτων, which Spitta understands of the first
creation of man. He defends this on the ground (1) that the pre»
