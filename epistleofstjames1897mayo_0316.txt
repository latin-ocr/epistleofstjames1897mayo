36 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

nay even ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν, St. Paul continues εἰδότες ὅτι ἡ θλίψις (Ξτὸ
δοκίμιον τῆς πίστεως or πειρασμός here) ὑπομονὴν κατεργάζεται. These two
stages may be considered the same as those given herc : but the third
seems inconsistent. Here endurance leads to the perfection of the
Christian character3 there the words ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ δοκιμήν apparently
reverse the first step of St. James. The word δοκιμή however is not ,
there used in the same sense as our δοκίμιον, 01 which it is rather the
result3 and this, the tried and tested character, is not very different
from St James' ‘ pei-fection, ² of which we may consider the two
following stages in St. Paul (ἡ δὲ δοκιμὴ ἐλπίδα, ἡ δὲ ἐλπις οὗ καταισ-
χυνει, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται) to be maiks or elements. There is
a similar chain, including ὗπομονή, 111 2 Pet. i. 5 foll., where however
there seems no attempt to give 3 natura] or chronological order.

5, εἰ δέ τις λείπεται cespius] The preceding λειπόμενοιό is caught up llke
τέλειος and ὖπομονή before. The thought omitted is thus supplied by
Bede : si quis vestrum uon potest iutelleyere utilitatem tentationum quae
fidelibus probandi causa eventum, postulet a Deo tribui sibi sensum quo
cliyuoscere valeat quauta pietate Pater castigat filios (⁴ how am I to see
trial in this light, and make this use of it‘l it needs a higher wisdom ').
The ideas of wisdom and pei-fection are often joined, as in 1 Cor. ii. 7
σοφίαν λαλοῦμεν ἐν τοῖς τελείοις, Col. 1'. 28 διδάσκοντες πάντα ἄνθρωπον
ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ ινα παραστήσωμεν πάντα ἄνθρωπον τελειον ἐν Χριστῷ,
ΧἮΞ(1.1Χ. 6 κᾶν γάρ τιςῄ τέλειος’ εν υἱοῖς ἀνθρώπων τῆς ἀπό σου σοφίας
ἀπούσης εἷς οἰδὲν λογισθήσεται. Hence Eulogius (fl. 590 A. D. )‚ quoted by
Heisen p. 37 a, speaks of η τελειόποιος σοφία θεοῦ. 011 the true nature 01
wisdom see below iii. 13. To St. James‚ as to the writer 01 the book of
J ob (where the necessity 01 wisdom to understand the use of trial is much
insisted on) and of the other sapiential books, wisdom is ⁴ the principa]
things to which he gives the same prominence as St. Paul to saith, St.
John to love, St. Peter to hope. Not that wisdom is neglected in the
other books of the N.T. : cf. Luke ii. 40, vii. 35, xi. 49, 1 Cor. i. 17
foll. (where true and false wisdom are contrasted), Col. i. 9 αἰτούμενοι
ἵνα πληρώθητε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει
πνευματικῇ, where see Lightfoot’s nobe, Eph. i. 17 ἵνα ὁ Θεὸς δῴη ὑμῖν
πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεως ἐν ἐπιγνώσει αὐτοῦ, πεφωτισμένους τοὺς
ὀφθαλμοὺς τῆς καρδίας εἰς τὸ εἶδέναι ὑμᾶς τίς ἐστιν ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς κλήσεως
αὐτοῦ, τίς ὃ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τῆς κληρονομίας κ.τ.λ., Which may serve as
3 commentary on the whole of this passage, esp. on verses 10 and 12.
The prayer for wisdom takes a more definitely Christian form in St.
Paul's prayer for the Spirit. Compare Plut. Mor. 351 C. πάντα μὲν
δεί. Τάγαθὰ 7·ng 'VOUV έΧΟνΤας αἰτεῖσθαι παρὰ Τῶν θεῶν’ μάλιστα δὲ Τῆς περὶ
αῧτῶν ἐπιστήμης, ὅσον ἐφικτόν’ εστιν ἀνθρώποις, μετιόντες εὐχόμεθα τυγχάνειν
παρ’ αὐτῶν ἐκείνων, ὡς οὐδὲν ἀνθρωπω λαβεῖν μεῖζον,οῧ χαρίσασθαι Θεῷ

σεμνότερον ἀληθείας.
αἰτείτω παρὰ. τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ πᾶσιν ιῖιπλῶς.] The great example IS
