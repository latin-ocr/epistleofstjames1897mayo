I 1-15 πειρασμός-πειράζεσθαι 187

Trial tests saith 3 the testing of faith produces endurance 3 endur-
ance, if it is continued till it attains its end, builds up the perfectly
matured Christian character, thoroughly furnished to all good works.
For an example of this testing of the saith, patiently endured to the
end, we may take the Syro-Phoenician woman. It is manifest what
strength of endurance, what unshaken trust in God, she must have
gained through that one victory. The converse is equally true.
Where there has been little trial, there has been little to test and
exercise saith, little experience of ourselves‚ little to instil the habit of
submission and resignation, little to lead us away from earth and up
to heaven. The old Greek proverb, παθήματα μαθήματα, is adopted by
the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews‚ and applied where, without
his sanction we might have hardly ventured to app] y it, in the words
καίπερ ὢν υἱὸς ἔμαθεν ἀφ’ ὧν ἔπαθεν τὴν ὑπακοήν.

But is not St. James' exhortation to rejoice in temptation
opposed to the petition ‘Lead us not into temptation‚' where the
same word πειρασμός is used in the same signification of external
temptation? In the Lord's Prayer however there is no reason
to limit its application to pain-temptation any more than in 1 Tixn.
vi. 9 <they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare). In
the next place one who is conscious of his own weakness may
without inconsistency pray that he may be kept out of tempta-
tion, and yet, when he is brought into it through no fault of his
own but by God’s providentia] ordering, he may feel such trust in
Divine support as to rejoice in an opportunity of proving his faithful-
ness. St. J ames speaks to those who are in the midst of trial, and in
danger of losing heart in consequence z it was evidently not God’s will
that they should be kept out of temptation, but that they should turn
it to good account 3 and this is what St. J ames encourages them to de.
Another way of explaining the difficulty is by a comparison of the
words in Matt. xxvi. 41 προσεύχεσθε ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἷς πειρασμόν. The
disciples to whom J esus addressed these words were already in a situa-
tion of extreme trial, and he does not propose to remove them from it τ
they are all to be sifted. Still they are to pray that they may not
enter into temptation, i.e. that they may be so supported by Divine
grace as to go through trial without its being able to tempt them. I
do not think however that there is any need to limit in this way the
meaning of the petition in the Lord⁷s Prayer.

Allowing that St. James is here thinking mainly of trial arising
out of affliction‚ how far may we generalize his ‘divers temptations ’ 2
Beside pain, sorrOW‚ fear, it will certainly embrace all sorts of per-
plexities, difficulties, disappointments, anxieties‚ anything which
troubles or annoys us. We are naturally inclined to wish them out
of the way, to think of them simply as interfering with the comfort
and happiness which we esteem our right. The true way is to regard
them as part of our schooling for heaven, helping to form the cross
which has to be borne by every Christian. We should strengthen
ourselves to bear them by looking away from the pain to the
good involved in it, if rightly borne. But may we also rejoice in
