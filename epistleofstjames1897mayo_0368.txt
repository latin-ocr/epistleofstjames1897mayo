88 THE EPISTLE OF sT. JAMES

find it without a following gen. in Rom. xiii. 10, xv. 2 3 τὸν ἕτερον is

used as its equivalent in Rom. xiii. 8, see Vorst‚ pp. 67, 562.

καλῶς ποιεῖτε.] Used ironically below Ver. 19, but here simply as in
2 Pet. i. 19 (τὸν λόγον) ᾧ καλῶς ποιεῖτε προσέχοντες, Acts X. 33, 1 Cor.
vii. 37, Phil. iv. 14. There is a similar phrase in the circular letter
written from the Council of Jerusalem, probably by St. James, in Acts
XV. 29 ἐξ ὧν διατηροῦντες ἑαυτοὺς εῧ πράξετε.

9. προσωπολημπτεῖτε] ἅπ. λεγ. see above Ver. l on προσωπολημψία.

ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε] See 011 1. 3 and 20, Matb. Vii. 23 ἐργαζόμενοι
ἀνομίαν.

ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ wip-om] ⁵ Being convicted by the laW,' personified
as witness, so 4 Maec. 5. 33 ὦ παιδευτὰ νόμε, cf. Rom. vii. 7, Gal. iii.
24. So we have ὑπὸ τὴς συνειδήσεως ἐλεγχόμενοι in the disputed passage
John viii. 9. The reference 13 to the law contained in Lev. xix, 15 μὴ
θαυμάσῃς πρόσωπον δυναστοῦ, which immediately precedes the ‘royal
law ' just cited.

ὡς παραβάται.] Similarly Homer uses ὑπερβαίνω and ὑπερβασίη [ί. i.
497. Παραβαίνω with an object, such as νόμους, and even θεούς (see
Herod. vi. 12), or absolutely (Aesch. Ay. 59), is quite classical 3 but the
only certain example of this use of παραβάτης 111 a classical author 13
from the treatise περὶ τῶν ἐν Σικελίᾳ θαυμαζομένων ποταμῶν of Polemo
(fl. about 180 Rc.) παραβάτης γενόμενος τῶν θεῶν ap. Macrob. Sat. V. 19 3
Epictetus (Diss. ii. 20. 14) uses τοῦς παραβατικῶς αὐτῆς ἔχοντας 111 the
same sense. 111 Euseb. II. st). V. 18 ὢν ἤδη παραβάτης, it is equivalent
to ἀποστάτης, and so in later writers. The metaphor is adapted to the
idea of righteousness as the way in which a man should walk. It
occurs absolutely Gal. ii. 18, with νόμου below ver. 11 and in Rom. ii.
25, 27 13 παράβασις 13 used by St. Paul and in Heb. ii. 2, ix. 15, and
παραβαίνω 111 this sense Matt. XV. 2, 3.

10. ὅστις ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ] ‘ VVhoever keeps the law as a whole,'
cf. Gal. v. 3. WVhen ὅστις takes the subj. it is usually joined with
ἂν, as in Matt. x. 33, xii. 50, Luke x. 35, John ii. 5, xiv. 13, Acts iii.
23, Gal. v. 103 when ἄν 13 omitted, the constant confusion of -ει and
-η 111 the MSS. makes it difficult to know whether the fut. or aor. snbj.
is the true reading. Beside this verse WH. give ὅστις ἀρνήσηται Matt.
x. 33. In classic-al Greek ἂν 13 occasionally omitted, both in poetry, as
Eur. Ion. 856 ὅστις ἐσθλὸς ᾗ, Medea 516, and in prose, as Thuc. iv. 18. 4.
οἵτινες νομίσωσι, ib. 17. 2 οὗ ἀρκῶσι, See Kiihner on Xen. Bsem. 1. 6. 13
ὅστις ποιῆται, ῪἯΠΘΥ, p. 386, A. Buttmann, 197. We find ἕως λάβῃ
without ἂν below v. 7, where see 11. 011 the Hellenistic use of τηρεῖν
with such words as νόμον see Vorst, p. 191 foll.

πταίσῃ δὲέν M] For πτ. see below iii. 2, Rom. xi. 11, Deut. vii. 25.
It is a question whether ἑνί and the following πάντων should be regarded
as masculine (agreeing with νόμῳ, νόμων) 01· neuter. It does not seem

¹· Dr. Plummer (p. 56) thinks the phrase may have been horrowed from the ‘un-
¹written word ' contained in the remarkable addition to St. Luke vi. 4, which we find
111 Cod. D, τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ θεασάμενός τινα ἐργαζόμενον τῷ σαββάτῳ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, ’'Av-
θριξπεςεῖ μὲν οἶδας τί ποιεῖς μακάριος εἶ, εἰ δὲ μὴ οἶδας ἐπικατάρατος καὶ παραβάτης εἶ
του ν( μου.
