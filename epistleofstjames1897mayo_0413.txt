It was a von· lechitica of the Stoics. Epict. Ena-le. 2 ὀρέξεως ἐπαγγελία
ἐπιτυχιά οὗ ὀρέγῃ, ἐκκλίσεως ἐπαγγελία τὸ μὴ περιπεσεῖν ἐκείνῳ ὃ ἐκκλίνεται.
οὐκ ἔχετε] Repeatecl like αἰτείτω in i. 5, G. lt iS not a further step.
διὰ. τὸ μὴ αἰτεῖσθαι. ὑμᾶς.] The subject of the infinitive is expressed
as in iii. 3, where see n.

3. αἰτεῖτε καὶ οὐ λαμβάνετε.] Yet in i. 5 he had said, quoting from the
Sermon on the Mount, αἰτείτω καὶ δοθήσεται. But the promise is not
unconditional. In the former passage stress is laid on the need for
simple saith in the worshippers, here on the right choice of things to
pray for.

Why is the active voice used here, and the middle immediately
before and afterwards? The latter has a slight additional shade
of meaning, which may be illustrated by the distinction (noted by
Dobree in Arnold’s n. on Thuc. v. 43) between δεινὰ ἐποίουν ‘they
expressed,⁷ and δεινὰ ἐποιοῦντο ‘they felt indignation ⁷,· and by Donald-
son’s distinction between ἰδεῖν ‘to see' and ἰδέσθαι ‘to behold,’ ‘see
with interest' (‘ in this particular use of the middle it will generally
be found to imply a certain special diligence and earnestness in the
aetion' WViner, p. 318>: cf. for this ‘ dynamio ² or ‘subjective ⁷ middle
Kr‘uger Gr. ξ 52. 8 and 10. Sturz in Lex. Xen. s.V. quotes Schol.
Aristoph. 156 αἰτοῦμαι τὸ αὐτὸ (τῷ αἰτῶ), ὥσπερ ποιῶ καὶ ποιοῦμαι, πλὴν ὅτι
τὸ μὲν αἰτῶ τὸ ἁπλῶς ζητῶ, τὸ δὲ αἰτοῦμαι τὸ μεθ’ ἱκεσίας, Phavorin. αἰτοῦμαι
τὸ μετὰ παρακλήσεως αἰτῶ καὶ ἱκετεύω. WVhen αἰτεῖτε is thus opposed to
αἰτεῖσθε, it implies using the words, without· the spirit of prayer. Other-
wise, where there is no special reason to emphasize this shade of meaning,
the active may be used to include the force of the middle, just as μετα-
πέμπω is used in the sense of ‘send for,' which strictly belongs to
μεταπέμπομαι. I add a few examples of the combination of the two
voices: 1 John V. 15 ἐὰν οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀκούει ἡμῶν ὃ ἂν αἰτώμεθα, οἴδαμεν ὅτι

explained by the words which follow, and is the opposite to 1 John v.
