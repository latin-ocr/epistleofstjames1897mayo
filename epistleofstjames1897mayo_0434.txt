154 THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES

and is never found in a good sense. The noun occurs Sir. xxvii. 13
γέλως αὐτῶν ἐν σπατάλῃ ἁμαρτίας, and Varro ap. Non. p. 46. 12 spcotule
eviravit omnes Venerivaya pueros ,· the compound verb κατασπαταλάω
Prov. xxiX. 21, Amos vi. 4. The classical word 01 the same root,
σπαθάω (fr. σπάθη, 1116 hatten, used in weaving for the purpose 01
driving home the threads 01 1116 woof), occurs in Dem. RL. p. 354,
where Shilleto says that the only example of the literal sense is the
play on words in the Nubes 55 ὦ γύναι λίαν σπαθᾷς, and that elsewhere
it only means ‘to squander.' In the text however the prominent idea
is that 01 sels-indulgence without distinct reference to squandering.

ἐθρέψατε-μὰς nefitus] No other instance 01 11115 phrase is recorded.
Oecumenius gives πιαίνομαι as the equivalent 01 τρέφω, and this agrees
with its use in Hom. Ocl. ix. 246 ἥμισυ θρέψας γαλακτός 01 turning milk
into cheese (whence τροφαλίς = cheese). It would thus have the same
force as παχύνειν τὴν καρδίαν Matt. Xiii. 15 quoted from Isa. Vi. 10, cf.
Luke XXi. 34 προσέχετε μήποτε βαρυνθῶσιν ὑμῶν αἶ καρδίαι ἐν κραιπάλῃ καὶ
μερίμναις βιωτικαῖς, καὶ αἰφνίδιος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἐπιστῇ ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη, Acts xiv.

ii. 5. The rich are represented as sinning (1) in getting their wealth
by injustice, (2) 111 spending it merely on their own pleasures. Their
folly is shown (1) in laying up their treasures on earth, (2) especially
in doing so in the very day of judgment, fattening themselves like
sheep unconscious of their doom. Dr. Plummer illustrates from J os.
BJ. v. 10. 2, ‘ Josephus tells us it was all one whether the richer Jews
stayed in the city during the siege or tried to escape to the Romans 3
they were equally destroyed in either case. Every such person was
put to death on the pretext that he was preparing to desert, but in
reality that the plunderers might get his possessione. . . Those whose
bodies showed no signs of privation were tortured to make them reveal
the treasures they were supposed to have concealed.' Even more
horrible is the description in v. 13. 4.

6. κατεδικάσατε] The word occurs Matt. xii. 7, Wisd. xi. 11, xii. 15,
and in the remarkable parallel 11. 20 θανάτῳ ἆσχήμονι καταδικάσωμεν
