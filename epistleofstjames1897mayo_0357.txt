Christ ² (qualitative genitive). Though the interval between the two
words πίστιν and δόξης in my opinion entirely precludes any qualitative
connexion, it is perhaps not so decisive against Grotius' interpretation.
To a certain extent we may find a parallel in i. 2 : τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς
πίστεως, ‘ the proof of your faith‚’ iS nob unlike τὴν πίστιν...Ἰησοῦ Χρισ-
τοῦ τῆς δόξης ‘ the saith in Christ's glory '3 but of course the harshness
becomes greater with every additional word which separates them, and
with the greater importance of those words. 3. It remains to consider
the interpretations which make τῆς δόξης depend upon the whole, or a
part, of the phrase preceding. These may be classified as follows
(a) δόξης depending on Χριστοῦ only 3 (b) depending on Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ
(c) on τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν 3 (d) on τοῦ Κυρίου understood 3 (e) on the whole
phrase τ. Κ. ἡ. Ἰ. Χ. (a) ‘The Messiah of glory' : so Laurentius, Schul-
thess, Lange, Bouman. The objection to this is, that it is impossible
thus to separate Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, and that in any case it would require
the article before Χριστοῦ. (b) So Ewald: ‘ Den Glauben unsers Herrn,
Jesus Christus der Herrlichkeit.' This seems to make an arbitrary
division of the words, and is also liable to the same objections as (e).
Moreover, do we ever find a proper name used with the genitive of
quality‘l (c) ⁶ Our Lord of glory‚ J esus Christ) So Schneckenburger
De Wette, Wiesinger. If this were the writer's meaning, why did he
not place the words τῆς δόξης after ἡμῶνΊ (d) ‘ Our Lord J esus Christ
(the Lord) of glory.’ So Baumgarten, Semler and others 3 but it is
without parallel, and is not supported by any of the latter commen-
tators. (e) ‘Of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ) So Rern, Alford,
Beysohlag, Erdmann, Sohegg, and the great majority of modern com-
mentators. We may allow that St. J ames makes frequent use of the
genitive of quality, as in i. 25 ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονῆς, ii. 4 κριταὶ διαλογισ-
μῶν πονηρῶν, &c : but it is very improbable that such a genitive would
be appended to a phrase which is already complete in itself 3 and we
may safely say that no one would have thought of such a construction
for this passage if the other suggested interpretations had not involved
equal or even greater harshness.

There is however a perfectly natural and easy construction sug-
gested by BengeL which has been set aside by later commentators
on what seem to me very inadequate grounds. His note is, ‘ τῆς
δόξης3 est appositio, ut ipse Christus driccam· ἡ δόξα...0]ιί·ι“3ίιιε {stov-iem
hinc fideles ylorz'osi. Hanc fidelium {florium nullus mundi honos
aequat, nemo personarum (acceptor aqnoscitsl The objection made
to it is that the abstract term δόξα, by itself‚ is too indefinite
to bear ‘this weight of meaning. But other abstractions are used
of Christ. He calls himself the Truth, the Life: He is called the
XVord, why not the GloryZ If we had before us such a sentence as μὴ
ἔχετε ἐν ἀφροσύνῃ τὴν πίστιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τοῦ λόγου,
we should have no scruple in translating it ‘ Do not hold in folly the
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the W0rd‚⁷ any more than we
have in translating 1 Tim. i. 1 κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Κυρίου Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τῆς

¹ W. H. in their marginal reading imply this construetion by placing a comma
after Χριστοῦ. Cf. lgn. Epa. 3 Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς τὺ ἀδιάκριτον ὑμῶν ζῆν.
