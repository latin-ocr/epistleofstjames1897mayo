ΙΙΙ 15-17] NOTEs 127

who are rude and violent: in Jeep. 397 D one who had before been
called μέτριος is referred to as ὁ ἐπιεικής, as in Thuc. i. 76 τὸ
ἐπιεικές = τὸ μετριάζειν ‘moderation' 3 hence its colloquial use in
Plato and Aristotle = σπουδαῖος or ἀγαθός. In the NT. it always
has the more special sense, and is twice joined with ἄμαχος (1 Tim. iii.
3, Tit. iii. 2): in 1 Pet. ii. 18 it is used of a master who is considerate
towards his slaves3 Acts xxiv. 4 Tertullus begs Felix 10 hear him with
his usual condescens-ion (ἐπιεικείᾳ) ; the most important passage is 2 Cor.
· X. 1 παρακαλῶ ὑμᾶς διὰ τῆς πραΰτητος καὶ ἐπιεικείας τοῦ Χριστοῦ, which
Matthew Arnold rendered by his phrase of ‘sweet reasonablenessss
compare Phil. iv. 5, &Visdom ii. 19 ὕβρει καὶ βασάνῳ ἐτάσωμεν αὐτὸν (the
just) ἵνα γνῶμεν τὴν ἐπιείκειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ δοκιμάσωμεν τὴν ἀνεξικακίαν αὐτοῦ,
ib. Xii. IS δεσπόζων ἰσχύος ἐν ἐπιεικείᾳ κρίνεις, Philo M. 2. p. 112 (Of God)
διὰ τὴν σύμφυτον ἐπιείκειαν καὶ φιλανθρωπίαν. It is the Greek equivalent
to the Roman clementia (App. BC. ii. 106). The history of the word
shows that it is etymologieally connected with εἰκός, implying that
which is fit and reasonable 3 but its later meaning was influenoed by
the idea of a connexion with εἵκω ‘ to yield‚' implying one who does not
stand on his rights, but is ready to give way to the wishes of others.

εὐπειθής] Νο1 found elsewhere in N.T. It is often used of military
discipline, as in 4 Mace. 8. 6, Jos. Bas. ii. 20. 7. We find it with agen.
Plato Legs. i. 632 B εῧπ. τῶν νόμων, with a dat. ib. vii. 801 εὐπ. τοῖς
νόμοις, With prep. ib. Vi. 718 C βουλοίμην ἂν αὐτοὺς ὡς εὐπειθεστάτους
πρὸς ἀρετὴν εἶναι. In the last passage it should probably be translated
‘ easy to be persuaded: as it follows the words ‘our exposition of the
law ¹ τὰ μὲν πείθουσα, τὰ δὲ μὴ ὑπείκοντα πειθοῖ...βι’ᾳ κολάζουσα, τὴν πόλιν
εὐδαίμονα ἀποτελεῖ. So Philo M. 2. p. 378 διδασκαλίαι εἶσὶ τοὺς μὲν εὐπει-
θεῖς μαλακώτερον ἅναπείθουσαι, τοὺς δὲ ἀπειθεστέρους ἐμβριθέστερον. The
opposite ἀπειθής, ἀπειθεῖν, ἀπείθεια occur several times in N.T. in the
sense of ‘disobedienee.' Musonius (ap. Stob. Ecl. p. 453, Peerlkamp
Fray. p. 227), answering the question whether obedience to a father is
always right, says that he alone is to be called εὐπειθής who willingly
Submits to a true fatherly will (ὃ τῷ τὰ προσήκοντα παραινοῦντι κατήκοος
ὢν καὶ ἑπόμενος ἑκουσίως, οὗτος εὐπειθής). AS ἐπιεικής refers mainly 10
one in a superior position, so I should understand εὐπειθής 10 refer to
an inferior, and translate ‘ submissive,' ‘ docile,' ‘ tractable‚' old English
‘buxom‚⁷ Lat. moriqem. The quarrels and rivalries in the Ohuroh
were due to fault-s on the side of the latter as well as of the
former.

μευ-τὴ ἐλέους καὶ καρπῶν amedu] See above vers. 8, ii. 13. An example
of such fruits is given in i. 27, while their absence is shown in ii. 15.

ἀὸιάκριτος.] Here only in NT. The meaning of διακρίνομαι above (i. 6,
ii. 4) makes it probable that we must understand the adj. here in the
sense of ‘single-minded‚' ‘ unhesitating' (undivided)‚ as in Heracleon
ap. Orig. Comm. in. Joh. xiii. 10 (Brooke’s Her-ael. p. 73) ἐπαινεῖ τὴν
Σαμαρεῖτιν ὡσὰν ἐνδειξαμένην τὴν ἀδιάκριτον...πίσ·τιν, μὴ διακριθεῖσαν ἐφ’
