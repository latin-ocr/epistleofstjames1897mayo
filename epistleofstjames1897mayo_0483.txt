Ι 19-27 SLOW TO WRATH 203

towards him as you would wish that another should act towards you
under like circumstances: that is, act for what you believe to be the
offender’s best interests, and in such a way as to arouse his own better
feelings.' This warning of St. 2] alnes against over-hastiness in wrath
may be compared with St. Paul's warning against too great persistency
in wrath, ‘Be ye angry and sin not, let not the sun go down upon
your wrath.'

The context however shows that St. James 15 not thinking so much
of the passion of anger in general, as of its indulgence under particular
circumstances. He is speaking of the way in which men should re·
ceive the Word. ‘ They should be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow
to wrath, seeing that the wrath of man does not work the righteous-
ness of God: therefore they are to receive with meekness the word of
salvation.' On a first reading we might be inclined to ask, Who ever
supposed that man’s wrath could work God's righteousness‘l Why
should St. James have given utterance to a truism like this ’Ζ But the
history of religion proves that there is no more common delusion than
this—that the best evidence a man can give of his own orthodoxy is
his bitterness towards the heterodoxy of others. The monarch's
private vices were atoned for by unsparing persecution of his heretical
subjects; to join a crusade against the infidel was regarded as a pass—
port to heaven; to burn a Protestant was an Act of Faith. The
odium tlzeoloyz'czc'iiz has passed into a proverb. Nor is it difficult to
understand why this should be so. Religion, with its vastly extended
horizon and its infinite possibilities as to the future, stimulates in a
very high degree the faculties of hope and fear, and in the more anxious
and less trustful natures tends to arouse an eager longing for some
positive assurance of personal safety. Such an assurance may be
either objective or subjective, it may be derived either from 1116 au-
thority of the Church without, or the supposed voice of the Spirit
within, testifying that we are children of God. The former assurance
may be found in the dogmatic coupling together of Conversion and
Final Perseverance as different aspects of the same fact, or in the
Viaticuln and Extreme Unction of the Church of Rome. The latter
assurance may be sought from the presence of what is regarded as an
overpowering religious emotion. In the last resort, the former also is
subjective, in as much as it depends 06 the degree of confidence placed
in the ecclesiastical authority to which a man has submitted himself:
and the fact that this confidence is liable to be shaken by the discovery
that others do not acknowledge the same authority, is one main cause
of the hatred of heresy, as tending to undermine a man's cwn faith
and destroy his own secui-ity. Then this very hatred,—itself‚ as we
have seen, the offspring of doubt and sear—becomes identified in our
thoughts with righteous indignation against sing and the more
fiercely it rages, the stronger is the conviction in the mind of the
persecutor, that he is the Jehu appointed to carry out the Divine
vengeance against the sinner, and that Paradise is secure to the
champion of the truth. Something of the same kind may be observed
wherever party spirit (the ἐριθία of the third chapter) runs high;
