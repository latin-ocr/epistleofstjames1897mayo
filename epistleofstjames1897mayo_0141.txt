CHAPTER VII

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DATE or THE ΕΡΙὸΤιΕ1

PART Ι

WE have seen in Chapter II. that the Epistle was recognized lfflglffinfeffile

as canonical at the third Council of Carthage (ΑΒ. 397), that it ffigffillzggid

was included in their lists of Sacred Writings by Athanasius in 367 *lffletssoepgif‘t‘ff

and by Cyril of Jerusalem in 348, that it is quoted by name as decadem&
authoritative by Eusebius in his Commenta& on tlte Psalmis (e. 330) ἳξὲἒῖῗᾶιιὲρ
and by Origen (c. 230> and is by both attributed, though with amussisfgifrmu
certain degree of hesitation, to James, the brother of the Lord'3 Epfflffl*
that it was apparently commented on, along with the other
Catholic Epistles, by Clement of Alexandria, and is referred to
anonymously by Irenaeus, Theophilus, Justin Martyr, the writers of
the Epistle to Diognetus and the so-called second epistle of
Clement‚ by Ignatius, Polycarp‚ above all by Hermas during the
second century ; by Clement of Rome, and the author of the Didache
during the lst century, also by Barnabas, and the author of the
Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, who are commonly assigned
to the same century. We have seen in Chapter I. that the
contents of the Epistle are entirely in harmony with the supposition
that it was written by James the brother of the Lord, who was
martyred in the year 63 according to Josephus, in 68 according to
Hegesippus. It agrees in character with all that we read of J ames
in the Epistles of St. Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles, it
agrees in style and diction with the speeches and letter of J ames
literally recorded in the latter book. In Chapter IV. we have
seen that it is quoted by several of the writers of the N. T.,

¹ It is not my aim here, any more than in other Chapters, to put forward an
independent scheme of chronology of my own ; but, assuming the general correctness

of the usually accepted chronology, I have endeavoured to determine, with reference
to it, the date of the Episfle, supposed to be previously unknown.
